Wish local in Mexico, Italy, and Spain made up 39%, 30%, and 22% respectively of all total orders from Wish. 

One anecdotal example of Wish local from the ceo is cigar shops in Italy. Several cigar shops in Italy saw many people coming in all the time to come pick up their wish orders of EarPods. Eventually the Cigar shops caught on and have started ordering the EarPods directly from wish to sell themselves in their Cigar shop.

This is my second post about $ERJ (first one here https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7a9yd/tired_of_boeing_hop_in_into_the_erj_plane/).

Since my previous post, the price for $ERJ has skyrocketed to $14+ but I still think there is a lot of catalysts to push the prices up. Here is a few of them:

- CPI data shows increase in airfare, therefore air travel demand has increased. Not only that, a lot of the new airline startups are giving preference to smaller jets rather than $BA behemoths.

- ERJ just announced merger with a SPAC (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/embraer-s-eve-said-in-2-billion-merger-talks-with-zanite-spac) on electric urban mobility vehicles (think flying cars).

- ERJ planes haven‚Äôt crashed ( I know, but worth mentioning that its a competitive advantage to $BA).

- ERJ is still bellow pre pandemic levels and below valuation from 2019 when the $BA merger was announced.

-My thesis is: fedboi is guna get fucky with inflation and rates. People will want to take a smaller loan out, and use more cash, because inflation creates spending and high interest rates deter people from collecting debt. Housing prices are in a bubble right now due to low rates. That bubble will pop when rates rise. Rates will rise, inflation will rise, cash spending will rise, debt will lower, houses will sell cheaper. REITs will continue to yield great earnings and totally recover; big tendies.   




MITT- [Pre-Covid=$16 Now=$4.4 (5.85% Short)](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/summary?fromPage=overview&amp;display=&amp;fromSearch=true&amp;symbol=MITT)

""I don‚Äôt follow that logic, I think higher rates with inflation will cause a net no change to house prices""

 -You don't think higher rates affect housing cost? 

 ""Yes, higher rates usually drop home prices but wouldn‚Äôt inflation pick it back up?"" 

-Inflation isn't considered *in the moment* the way rates are. Inflation takes 3months to two years for change to occur. When you get a quote for an interest rate, at max it'll last 3 months before you gotta pull a trigger

-As inflation rises, people will have more cash to spend, which leads to more cash up front for down payment. Usually, a higher down payment = negotiation of lower house price.  
-So, people will have both, more cash for down payment and a higher interest on a loan = perfect leverage for a lower price, this means a higher execution of sales... 

 ""Wouldn‚Äôt that create higher demand?"" 

-Demand is high right now, highest it has ever been. But, that doesn't lead to execution if the buyer isn't comfortable with the price. A lot of deals that have gone on this year failed to execute. This is usually because a homeowner sends in the inspector and lists some things to knock price down (which is typical) and the homeowner doesn't budge because they were only ever interested in selling for the ridiculously high prices other homes are selling for. House doesn't sell and homeowner ends up waiting for a better time in the market than in the middle of winter (when rates were lowest and demand was still growing)

-Lower rates create higher demand. Demand is super high right now, another reason prices are ballooned too much. Demand cant get higher than where it is, so I believe it will go down when people get rates twice what they were 3 months prior. 

-My point being, the price will come down when it gets to brass and taxes. Houses will sell and people will be there to buy. REITs will still pull hefty profits and will recover.  


TL;DR- Mortgage services and the real estate market over all has been unaffected. They still have great earnings and fundamentals will bring the cyclical investing back towards them. They will go up. I made this post a few months ago and have been heavy on all of these. Been earning fatty returns

Financial Disclosure At End.

STAR - iStar Inc is a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a market cap of 1.28 billion dollars, their primary focus is on ground leasing. There are examples below where STAR gets their revenue under these circumstances of ground leasing. They do through their subsidiary of SafeHold. (STAR owns 2/3s of SafeHold)

1. A factory in need of cash. The factory will sell the land under their factory to STAR and then STAR will lease it back to the factory. (49% of revenue figure includes net leasing)
2. STAR purchases raw land, develops the land and leases or sells the land to a new business. (33% of revenue this number includes residential)

For those interested in how financially strong their ground leasing subsidiary is. You can find their financials on yahoo finance ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SAFE/financials?p=SAFE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SAFE/financials?p=SAFE))

STAR is also involved in residential development and is currently building out one development with 3500+ homes and another massive development in the pipeline with an estimated 16450 homes with over 700 acres of industrial/commerical development. The average sale price of homes sold by STAR is above 500k. (Source: [https://www.istar.com/our-businesses/other-businesses/](https://www.istar.com/our-businesses/other-businesses/))

STAR also provides other financing services to home buyers and business owners. (12% of revenue)

Before the pandemic STAR was an exceptional company that flourished with high earnings and I admit they have seen better days. However, I firmly believe the bad days are behind them now with nearly 10+ billion dollars in revenue in the pipeline from just residential development. I am placing a target price of $22.75 without any WSB fuckery. They also recently increased their quarterly dividend to $0.125 to common stock holders. That is 50 cents a year just sitting on the stock. That is why it's marketed to mutual funds and ETFs as a relatively safe security.

Below is a one week chart of $STAR. After market today is currently sitting at $17.95 as of 06/08/2021(aftermarket).

Now, what first attracted me to STAR was its short interest. I know. I know. Oh god another short squeeze bullshit pitch. Tough shit, I think everyone and their Pewdiepie watching 9 year old child is looking for the next meme stock.

Now is there a potential squeeze situation here. The fuck if I know. But I will get into some key factors and you can make up your own bloody ape minds.

STAR has a total 70.24M shares in float or the number of shares that are currently available to the market.

Of those shares 20.79% or 14.6 million are shorted. These are the exchange reported numbers provided by Ortex. However, Ortex estimates the true number of shares shorted is 15.79 million. (Source Ortex and Images Provided Below)

&amp;#x200B;

Getting to how Mutual Funds and ETFs play a large part in any potential short squeeze. Of all shares in float 31.39% are held by ETFs and mutual funds. (Source: [https://www.etfchannel.com/etfs/?symbol=star](https://www.etfchannel.com/etfs/?symbol=star)) Image provided below.

These 22.04 million shares are essentially locked away from the shorts. There is only 1 way for the shorts to gain access to these shares and that is to buy up all outstanding shares in each mutual fund/ETF and force redemption. That is unlikely. For example, IJR is the largest holder of STAR among the ETFs and it's worth over 72 billion dollars. (Source: [https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/ijr/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/ijr/))

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With 22.04 million shares and ever increasing with cash inflows into mutual funds and ETFs. Yes, these funds are purchasing a steady supply each day due to cash inflow into their funds. Let us exclude these 22.04 million shares from float for the sake of the argument.

The real floated shares can be estimated to be 48.2 million shares and the short interest just above 30%.

The daily average volume traded is about 950k shares. Most of the buying is conducted by ETFs and mutual funds. Now let us say there was an increase in share price to $20. The shorts may start to cover their position. But they won't be able to do it fast enough with the trading volume available to them. They would need to recover 14.6 million shares when the daily average volume is 950k that is dominated by purchases by ETFs and Mutual Funds. That would take them weeks of purchasing to cover during a normal trading environment. All while the share price continue to climb due to increased buying pressure. Melt up. Below is an image of how long it took the shorts to build up their short interest.

Hedgies would have to fight each other for the shares. (Someone go make some memes of Hedgies fighting each other)

Spot-market prices for hot-rolled coiled steel in Southeast Asia are $900 a metric ton, and the cost of a shipping container has more than doubled since the start of the year. 

Imports, which typically make up about a quarter of the finished steel consumed in the U.S. annually, last year accounted for 18%, the lowest share since 2003, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. So far this year, imports have been running at about the same rate, the trade group said. U.S. tariffs, high prices and growing demand for steel in foreign markets are holding down import volumes.

Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is keeping about seven million tons of production capacity out of service. That is roughly a tenth of domestic consumption in 2019, according to Metal Strategies Inc., an industry consulting firm. 

Steel prices, meanwhile, have reached records. Spot-market steel prices have climbed more than 60% since the start of the year to more than $1,600 a ton, according to S&amp;P Global Platts. 

TL;DR - Steel companies are share price has been reflecting this demand. Suppose you look at NUE, X, MT over the past year. CLF is finally getting its due diligence, and its share price reflects the steel market demand!"|wallstreetbets|CLF - we like our steel now üíéüôåüöÄ|157.0|0.8

If there is ever one stock which facilitates the gambling marketplace for mobile games and trading at reasonable valuation, it‚Äôs none other than $SKLZ. This one stock can make your dream of becoming a millionaire come true with huge upside in the upcoming years 
Skillz ($SKLZ) is the publicly traded e-sports platform where millions of players compete for cash prizes. The games literally look like shit but people play for money with a fee to enter the tournament for the chance to win real money. 
As the payouts are huge, most of the users are addicted to this platform and spend an average of whopping 60 mins on their platform. As a matter of fact, Skillz currently ranks above Facebook, TikTok and YouTube on the average length of time its users spend per day on their platform as per their investor presentation.
Key considerations for investment 
1.	Trading at valuation of $8.9B. Super cheap when compared to a total TAM of $175B across the geographies (Source: Investor presentation for TAM)
2.	FY2020 reported revenues of $230M (&gt;92% YoY growth). ~376M by 2021. $550M by 2022 (Source: Company filings &amp; consensus estimates)
3.	Lead by Andrew Paradise (impeccable track record AisleBuyer acquired by Intuit; Double Picture acquired by MPA). 
4.	They just went public by the same guys that took Draftkings $DKNG public, Jeff Sagansky and Harry Sloan; Continuously  supported by Cathie Wood who only looks for investments with disruptive innovation &amp; higher return potential (&gt;10x)
5.	2.7M Monthly Active Users; 1.9 million paid entry daily tournaments; GMV of $1.6B (Latest 10Q quarterly report)
6.	Differentiated Business Model: Although Skillz‚Äôs end market is mobile gaming, its model differs vs. traditional mobile game publishers. To start, Skillz operates a competition-based, multiplayer platform that drives engagement through competition. Skillz players submit to tournament entry fees, while mobile game publishers generate the majority of their bookings through in-app purchases and typically monetize less than 5% of the playing population, in addition to advertising. (Source: Company filings &amp; Investor presentation)
7.	Take rate of ~15% and an impressive 95% Gross margin. Adj. EBITDA to be positive by 2022. Contribution is already positive &amp; expected to reach $245M by 2022E (Source: 10-K, Investor presentation &amp; consensus expectations)
8.	Growth! Growth! Growth. Competition is now closed for submitting game by developer for NFL. NFL with its massive following of 100M people worldwide shall sponsor the game to the fans &amp; guess what people who download the game shall be on-boarded on to the Skillz experience &amp; some of which will become members on the platform. Huge cross-selling opportunity within the rapidly growing user base.

9.	Acquisition of Aarki to broaden SKLZ‚Äôs footprint: $150M acquisition of Aarki, a technology driven marketing platform shall give access to advanced Machine Learning algorithms to be augmented by Skillz‚Äôs deep first party data. Aarki‚Äôs reach of ~465 Million monthly users will extend Skillz‚Äôs player acquisition capabilities
10.	Another lever for growth! Google‚Äôs PlayStore news shall increase the growth in terms of user base growth across 15 countries which is a huge revenue booster (expands the TAM by at least $15B as mentioned in the investor presentation)
11.	Bottom-line: With expected sales to be ~$550 million in 2022 (~60% CAGR), very high gross margins (~95%), zero debt, an enormously growing gaming industry, an extremely diverse user base, and higher user engagement on the platform makes it a no brainer buying option in 2021


Also remember that INDIA NFL and NEW GAMES are ALL DISCOUNTED from they projections! On the last earnings call the CEO Andrew clearly mentioned that SKILLZ only puts out projections for games already launched.

The Case for WISH Stock
That‚Äôs where ContextLogic has an upper hand on other stocks affected by social momentum trading ‚Äî there is actually fundamental turnaround playing out here that could push the stock towards $20.

Wish.com is a value-first mobile commerce platform that is basically a digital version of a garage fire sale. The physical market for this is huge. Just look at how popular stores like Dollar Store, TJ Maxx and Ross have become. They‚Äôre everywhere.

Big companies have been built on the physical value-first retail market.

Now, big companies will be built on the digital value-first market. And Wish.com will be one of them.

The niche that Wish.com dominates is essentially connecting super cheap Chinese retailers with European and American shoppers looking for a steal. Sometimes the products aren‚Äôt quite what is advertised. But shoppers know this. Something that costs a few bucks could turn out to be worthless‚Ä¶ Or it could be a decent quality item obtained at an insane bargain.

Shopping on Wish.com is a treasure hunt. When you find a treasure ‚Äî that solid product for only $2 ‚Äî you‚Äôre on cloud nine.

The other thing we really like about Wish.com is its team. Though you might not expect it from a ‚Äúdigital garage sale‚Äù company, their personnel are extremely qualified to lead this company. Wish.com‚Äôs founder is a former Google exec, for example, and their head of data science comes from Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) ‚Äî the same individual who leveraged machine learning algorithms to create hyper-personalized shopping experiences.

Long story short, in value-first mobile commerce, Wish.com is unique and technologically sound enough to emerge as a big player in this market.

Meme stock mania will fade. WISH stock might fall. But, when it does fall, buy the dip. This stock could power on to $20 on strong fundamentals in the medium-term. An upcoming dip from meme trading fallout presents a perfect opportunity to get into ContextLogic at a great price."|wallstreetbets|WISH(ContextLogic) Has a Bright Future Despite Being an offlate WSB talk.

# Canada:

It might surprise you but BB is a Canadian company üá®üá¶ . One thing all Canadian federal parties (LPC, CPC, BQ, NDP, GPC) have in common is ***they heavily support Canadian companies no matter what***. Not only that, people in Canada still reminiscent about BB and their role in Canadian history.

[Here is CEO John Chen at Public Policy Forum in 2019 on why he chose to stay in Canada and the support he got from the federal Canadian Gov. I highly recommend you watch the whole section since it highly speaks of BB's culture. (0:53 - 4:18).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hQQlCWMrQA&amp;t=53s)

[Here is starting from the juicy part (1:53 - 4:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hQQlCWMrQA&amp;t=113s)

# Facebook Settlement:

[Here is Bloomberg reporting in January 2021 that Facebook and BlackBerry has settled with no further details.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement)

1.	[CEO John Chen confirms their licensing negotiation involves the complete sale of the majority of BB's portfolio (@34:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&amp;t=2088s)

`Transcript:`

`Michael Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity Group -- Analyst`

`... Should you complete the sale, just the vast majority of your portfolio and you won't have any licensing revenue going forward? ...`

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`Well, it's a major portion of our portfolio.`

&amp;#x200B;

2) [Deal involves one huge payment followed by a tail revenue and keeping IVY and QNX(36:53 - 38:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&amp;t=2213s)

`Transcript:`

`Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst`

`Hi, John. Just a question about how you're hoping to structure the deal for the patent sale. Should we expect ongoing royalties to come from, maybe you get a portion of the licensing fees that you are -- that the buyer will take or is this more of a one-time deal?`

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`There is a majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on. I can't give you the details of this, but for multiple number of years.`

`Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst`

`Okay, now you mentioned in the past that you've had offers for the entire portfolio. So what's different now that's making you consider selling it.`

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`There re two reasons. Number one is, I really think it is a wrong thing to sell the entire portfolio because there is so much of our -- we have an ongoing business in cybersecurity and an ongoing business in BTS which of course includes IVY and QNX. I think selling those portfolio will be extremely unwise for the company and for the shareholders.`

&amp;#x200B;

3) [Tail revenue is up to SEVEN years (@47:31).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&amp;t=2851s)

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`Yeah. Paul, that's a good question. So this is an unusual year. So let's talk about, if the patent license goes through, if the sale goes through, we will have -- we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.`

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is huge. It shows that:

1.	BB is in the upper position in negotiation by the fact that Facebook is willing to buy a majority of BB's patents upright to avoid trial
2.	BB is in the position to negotiate up to 7 years of licensing revenue after their sale.
3.	BB has a clear business plan post sale.

The premise is that you order something off the website, then you ‚ÄúWish‚Äù you get what you ordered. Based on my intensely quantitative research, there is a \~1/3 probability of getting the correct item (i.e. the rest of the time, you get something else). Delivery time is usually a few weeks to forever (i.e. you may never receive your order).

Wish‚Äôs main competitive advantages are the following:

**1.** **Plethora of unique items:** Wish is home to some very unique items that you won‚Äôt be able to find elsewhere. Best of all, the stuff is real cheap - all apes will be able to afford Wish products even if you blew up 99% of your account in the casino! Below are examples of Wish products.

* [Purple Blanket](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpectationVsReality/comments/7fxz2r/i_knew_i_was_taking_a_gamble_ordering_from_wish/)

**2.** **Unparalleled ecosystem of sellers:** The sellers on Wish are mainly Chinese merchants who are generous enough to respond to the reviews left by customers. [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTFwish/comments/n7zd9n/bad_review_seller_response/) for a prime example. 

**3.** **Plenty of shorts:** Wish has tons of shorts sales, including [PNMA shorts](https://www.wish.com/search/shorts/product/5ecf2968ee8cdf103a1cee31?source=search&amp;position=19&amp;share=web) and [BO$$ shorts](https://www.wish.com/search/shorts/product/605986750944c93f4f00c740?source=search&amp;position=44&amp;share=web).

**4. Temporarily satisfies ‚Äògoing concern‚Äô assumption:** According to the [Q1 earnings report](https://ir.wish.com/static-files/d3f81305-56c3-4a4f-b76f-034b1b413d77), Wish only burned $345 million in cash in the first quarter. Wish currently has a cash balance of $1.62 billion. This is very bullish because it means that Wish will be around at least for another 4.69 quarters (let‚Äôs say until June 2022). Importantly, Wish call options only go to January 2022, meaning that there is plenty of time for the calls to moon before the company goes bankrupt.

* Panic selling is mostly over - TAL hit $25 and has been climbing up since; its poised for a V-shape recovery (China isn't gonna fucking ban tutoring lol, that'll open up a black market for tuition)
* Financial institutions are buying this shit up - only CS cut PT to $26 from $54 because they're shit (look at Archegos lmao) while MS, UBS, and BlackRock, etc. are adding massive positions (10%, 10%, and 7% respectively)
* Much of the stock price was hit by a fake WeChat message that spread the rumor that tuition wouldn't be allowed on weekends and PH. The Chinese Education Bureau has come out to clarify that it's fake but the market hasn't reacted.
* TAL's average PT is **still $77** after CS's clownish downgrade which cut its PT by half, implying a ~170% upside - 25 buy ratings, 1 OW, 4 hold, 0 UW, 1 sell (CS)
* 2021 revenue was $4.5B, a 37.35% increase YoY. Analysts expect exponential growth -- $6.3B in 2022, $10.1B in 2024, and $20B in 2026 (4.5x today)


You'll want to get in **before China announces the actual regulations** which will likely be advertising bans etc. to ride on the V-shape recovery; all of the weekend/PH tutoring bans have been priced in but is honestly unlikely to go through

As the value of fiat currency decreases (thx Jpow), powerhouses are in a race for commodities. Both China and the U.S have embarked on post-pandemic infrastructure projects. Combine this with the new era of EV production (there's an Elon joke in her somewhere), and we've sent iron ore and steel into ATHs.

**CHINA**

is by far the world's biggest steel producer and net exporter, at almost 9x the production capability of India (#2).

Prices in steel-related commodities are [fucking mooning](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel) in both global markets and domestically. Dalian, Tianjin, Shanghai commodity exchanges all seeing highs. Chinese steel production peaked twice this year, in April and March.

\- A little more than a month ago, Chinese officials **recalled their 13% VAT Rebate on steel exports,** without providing exporters or foreign buyers with a transitionary period. The world's biggest steelmaker just said **fuck you, we're keeping our steel.**

\- From China's POV, it's a smart move. They stabilize domestic markets while decreasing their (worrisome) trade surplus, and an excess of domestic supply could fuel future infrastructure projects.... blah blah blah I know you apes aren't here for this boomer macro shit. Moral of this paragraph is, China probably won't reinstate that VAT rebate any time soon.

**So What?**

you would think the rest of the world could just tell China to fuck off and make their own steel, but *Chinese steel still trades at a significant discount to the rest of the global commodities market.* Long story short, Chinese labor is cheap, the country's inspection agencies and most of its producers are state-run, so no one inspects anything or gives a fuck. And right now, everyone just wants to fucking buy steel.

**IN APE LANGUAGE/ TLDR:**

*Imagine you're thrown on Ape Island for 7-9 quarters with 500 dudes, 5000 apes, and 50 hookers. Naturally, you and the other dudes/apes get a lil urge. High demand = the hookers get a lot of work. They gradually increase their prices (because, for the lack of a better analogy, the supply of fiat currency has vastly outpaced the production of commodities).  There's this one group of hookers who sleeps with everyone for the cheapest. All the sudden, they say fuck it I'm not fucking yall anymore* ***im only going to fuck myself***\*.\*

You're fucked.

Everyone on Ape Island is fucked.

Now, you've gotta go to the other hookers.

**Basically, $CLF is one of the other hookers**

it's got the strongest fundamentals so think of it as the hooker with the nicest butt or something

Pyrogenesis wants to be a leader in plasma-based solutions to the worldwide movement to reduce the carbon footprint in manufacturing. This is why the sector will keep growing. In 2019, the market size was valued at USD 47.63 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.7% from 2020 to 2027 or USD 61.43 billion.

Moreover, PyroGenesis is implemented in the additive market, which represents a $774 Million valuation and expect to grow to a $3.2 Billion market valuation in 2024. The market could quadruple fast.¬†

Dubitative about growth prospect ? Pyrogenesis is currently in discussion with 3 clients about 3,000 torches for Iron Ore Pelletization. 1 torch is worth $3M Net Present Value. The market is in a desperate need of solutions and this market could represent a crazy $10B worth.

During the last earnings quarter report, PYR showed all its economical strength and the huge upside above them. Among the outstanding statements, we can highlight these ones:¬†

* Revenues of $6,264,503, an increase of 771% over $718,908 posted in Q1 2020;
* Gross margin profit of $2,143,010 an increase of 701% vs. $267,414 in Q1 2020;

Pyrogenesis has great fundamentals, and is in the right market as the global warming is in everybody‚Äôs mind. They are the leader in their sectors, have made the right partnerships and the niche products that are highly needed.

I believe it is important to understand the following:

1. **Short Volume Ratio != Short Interest**
2. **Short Volume:** ""total number of short shares traded on the major US markets each day"" (Fintel)
3. **Short Volume Ratio:** ""Total number of short shares traded divided by the total shares traded each day"" (Fintel)
4. **Short Interest**:  ""Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short interest, which can be expressed as a number or percentage, is an indicator of market sentiment."" (Investopedia)
5. **Short Interest is typically the north star metric**

I hope this helps you make **informed** decisions.

10 days ago I did some DD about Wish, which came right at the bottom : [DD to My Wife](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nolcn9/wish_contextlogic_dd_i_showed_to_my_wife_to_let/?sort=new) (Mods : It's my DD)  
Now My Wife is very happy, and she may consider breaking out with her Boyfriend who was All in on C3AI.  
The main goal of the DD was to present to you a great opportunity (at least for me) of a company that have a great potential and really undervaluation. The goal is not to make it a meme stock (but if we get both of them this can be great), because fundamentally the company have great numbers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now Why I think Wish is preparing to go to moon ?  
1- It had a short float average (9M\~ day) in the last 6 months, but for the last 10 days it's about 20M \~ Day. And as we all know, when the consolidation is done with a very a high volume, it's just the sound og the gas added to the rocket ! And now The breakout was done with 200M/300M Dayly volume, which is a tremendous Bullish sign. 

2- 40 % short interest, t's very high for a company with good fundamentals at the bottom

3- until now the big boys were adding shares, in the same time they were selling puts, and I you know institution will only sell puts when it thinks the company will go up or it's under-evaluated (so they will be more than happy if they got assigned).

4- Consider Best Buy in 2012, when everyone thought bankruptcy was inevitable and Best Buy stock had plunged from $40 to $10. Today, shares trade north of $100.

Consider Nintendo in 2013, when everyone thought the gaming titan had lost its magic touch and the stock also dropped from $40 to $10. Today, Nintendo stock trades above $60.  
Or even Etsy for which the IPO price was 16$, the first day of trading went to 35$.  
After that It went back to 6$ in 6 months

Well look at it now 167$ !!!

Or consider Twitter in 2016‚Ä¶ Crocs in 2017‚Ä¶ Chipotle in 2018‚Ä¶ Tesla in 2019‚Ä¶ Wayfair in 2020‚Ä¶

Finally, this is maybe a ""dumpster diving"" that have a great 300% potential, as a GME fun and past retard investor, I know the facts , and the facts saying that on Wish we are at the Bottom, and the upside potential is there"|wallstreetbets|WISH : do not forget, Before or after the rally, it's still under-evaluated|341.0|0.78

For new investors: the average price target consensus was over $30 earlier in the year but the overall market and tech pullback a few months ago brought down the average price target consensus to $24.80 (but two analysts who know the company well re-affirmed their strong buy recommendations a month ago with price targets each at $33). Now if you're value investor and just take the current $24.80 average price target consensus that represents 71% upside right now (strong buy).  


However, this is also a fast growing tech stock with a ground-breaking disruptive platform called 'illumin' in the growing field of digital/online advertising. In other words, they are growing fast and are going to enter the Nasdaq - where all the adtech stocks are starting to rise again - at just the perfect time. This IS the baby brother thesis playing out before our eyes.  


After it's on the Nasdaq people will wish they bought more during this pre-listing time especially when the gravity of the positive catalyst of having the support of Laura Needham starts to sink in.  


This will likely hit 100 Canadian a share in 2-3 years (that is only a 5B m/c Canada). MGNI trades at that already and TTD is around 28B US m/c. Who knows exactly how long but, again, 5B m/c is quite reasonable and eventually it could hit 10B m/c (for those willing to hold long term).  


Buying opportunity right now for smart buy/hold type investors - do your homework and research but do it quick because this will likely be back to 30 Can (easy double) shortly after being listed on the Nasdaq (and maybe even on opening day, most likely sometime this summer). And in two months when Q2 numbers hit this will again rise... and keep rising.  


Tal Hayek was releasing tons of big new contracts news with illumin a while back (such as the Amazon partnership) but he appears to be holding back on the news, most likely so that big news can be released on or around the official date it hits the Nasdaq.  


Many of us knew this day was going to happen (and many shorts tried to steal shares from weak hands) but the facts are the facts: this is a fast growing company with strong fundamentals who possess a disruptive new technology in the even bigger and growing market of digital advertising - and now they're going to hit the Nasdaq.

India tourism is a thriving industry with millions of people travelling abroad for tourism purposes, and MMYT ensures that tourists have a safe and pleasant stay while visiting the country. Tourism in India is predicted to grow 6.9% annually, thats a $450 billion dollar industry by 2028.  


The global online travel booking space is a difficult place to operate and there is limited room for significant growth in the business, as penetration of internet and mobile phones continues to grow. The company is expanding aggressively and expanding out of its core business of selling flight tickets to a broader range of products, ranging from accommodation and food to car rentals.  


India's economy has been on the rise for a decade now, with GDP growth rates at an all time high. As per a report released by the World Bank, India was the third fastest growing economy in the world with a GDP growth rate of 7.6 per cent. Inflation has also fallen to a record low, with consumer inflation at 2.18 per cent in October as compared to 6.6 per cent in October 2017.

$MMYT has been underrated by the market for years now, as a result I'd expect to see it blow up at some point in the next 2 - 3 years and I'm willing to buy it at prices higher than what are considered to be good values today.

AEVA $11.19 in the red right now
ROOT $11.50 in the green right now
SDC $9.94 no change yet. 

Some good starting prices, lets hope we have an eventful day like yesterday on these 4.

Predictions:

Well RIDE may of secured funding, if so the price should level out around $12 maybe push for a high.

SDC Pretty much finished where it started yesterday so probably an increase then a drop down to around $10.

AEVA was on a downward track so looking for an increase here.

ROOT was hitting some highs yesterday so probably a dip then leveling out around $14.

My number one electric vehicle stock to buy for the long haul, Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV), got pummeled in late March. GOEV stock sold off near-40% after the EV maker announced on its first-ever conference call as a public company some surprising changes to its team, business model and vision.

Wall Street didn‚Äôt like the changes, mostly because they result in revenue projections being revised significantly lower over the next few years. GOEV stock plunged more than 20% in response.

But the changes management announced on the call do not at all impact the company‚Äôs core value props, which are its technology, its engineering team and its IP. Instead, they are changes related to how the company plans to monetize its ultra-valuable multi-purpose-platform (MPP).

While such changes will result in less revenue in the short-term, they should also result in the more revenue and profits in the long-term. Also of the note, the management changes are mostly finance-related, and do not materially impact Canoo‚Äôs ability to improve its underlying MPP technology, which is the only thing that really matters here.

To that end, my long-term bullish stance on GOEV stock remains unchanged.

I continue to believe that Canoo has assembled a world-class engineering team that has created a transformative MPP technology which will create a new generation of new-and-improved consumer and commercial electric vehicles that maximize interior vehicle space, and are therefore, exceptionally useful when applied to family vehicles, pick-up trucks and delivery vans.

In that context of that big picture, the selloff in GOEV stock looks like a golden long-term opportunity.

Here‚Äôs a deeper look:

GOEV Stock: A Shocking Conference Call

One look at the GOEV stock chart, and you can easily tell that Canoo‚Äôs fourth-quarter conference call went pretty poorly.

The call itself was full of shocking surprises that had analysts scratching their heads.

First, the company basically said it will scrap its engineering services business. Originally, the story at Canoo was that the company was going to provide engineering services to other auto makers to help them make EVs on top of Canoo‚Äôs MPP technology, and that this revenue would help the company subsidize operations until it developed sufficient manufacturing capacity to make tens of thousands of its own vehicles. Last year, Canoo announced an engineering services partnership with Hyundai.

But that partnership is now dead, and it looks like the reason why is because Canoo has decided to deemphasize its engineering services business in order to protect its IP. Makes sense. Back in its original projections, however, Canoo was calling for all of its revenues in 2021 and most of its revenues in 2022 to be from this now-defunct engineering services division.

In other words, Canoo‚Äôs 2021 and 2022 revenue estimates need to move significantly lower.

Second, Canoo also said they are moving away from the subscription business model for its lifestyle vehicles. Remember, a big part of the Cannoo story was that the company was trying to pioneer a new subscription business model wherein consumers could rent its vehicles on monthly subscription plans. But, due to balance sheet risks inherent to that model, management is moving away that model in favor of just selling vehicles directly to consumers.

Third, as an extension of changing its business model from engineering services and subscription sales, to vehicle B2C and B2B sales, management is pulling its original long-term model offered when the company announced its SPAC merger.

Fourth, the CFO is out ‚Äî and that‚Äôs never great news when a top-level C-suite executive resigns just months after the company goes public.

Oh, and against the backdrop of all those changes, the company‚Äôs CEO wasn‚Äôt even on the conference call. Instead, the call was headed by Tony Aquila, the company‚Äôs Executive Chairman who joined in October 2020.





Breaking Down the Changes

At first glance, the aforementioned changes announced on Canoo‚Äôs conference call look like deal-breakers for GOEV stock. But they aren‚Äôt. At all.

Remember, all of the value at Canoo rests on the company‚Äôs world-class engineering team and the signature MPP technology they have collectively developed. None of the changes announced on the conference impact that value.

A switch away from engineering services protects the IP of that technology. Sure, it eliminates a revenue source. But, at the same time, it should boost Canoo‚Äôs direct-to-consumer and direct-to-business sales channels at scale, since no one else will be building vehicles on top of this MPP technology.

The subscription business model was a cool idea that, if it worked out, would‚Äôve been nice. But it was always a long shot. And without it, Canoo will still sell tons of lifestyle vehicles, trucks, and vans. No change there. Profit margins also won‚Äôt be impacted by this change, since Canoo still plans to resell the same MPP chassis multiple times ‚Äî which is where the higher margins come from anyways.

Scrapping the model out to 2025 reduces visibility. But doesn‚Äôt change the underlying technology or its ability to scale. By 2025, I actually think revenues will be higher under this new business model than the previous one, given higher volume of B2C and B2B sales.

And, finally, the finance team isn‚Äôt driving the value at Canoo. The engineering team is ‚Äî and that engineering team remains fully in-tact. So long as that remains true, the future of Canoo will look bright.

What Really Happened

In my opinion, here‚Äôs what really happened at Canoo:

You have this world-class engineering team. They developed this breakthrough MPP technology. They then got a bunch of not-world-class finance and strategy folks to put together a game-plan to monetize that technology. That game-plan was half-baked, and risked the company‚Äôs IP via engineering agreements with competitors, while also putting stress on the balance sheet via subscription sales.

So, when some more experienced business people came into the business following the SPAC deal ‚Äî including longtime technology business exec Tony Aquilla ‚Äî they convinced the Board to make some big changes to the strategy side of the business. They‚Äôre making those big changes right now, and at the end of the day, Canoo will emerge as a company with both a great technology and a great game-plan to monetize that technology.

Long-term, then, I feel the tough changes Canoo is making today actually position the company for bigger and more durable growth.

Specifically, having full control over the IP widens Canoo‚Äôs technological moat, selling via upfront sales should actually boost cash flows and reduce down balance sheet risks, and focusing on the commercial market mostly allows Canoo to maximize the biggest advantage of its MPP technology, which is that it maximizes interior space of vehicles.

Strategically, I like these changes. I understand Wall Street‚Äôs having a tough time digesting them. Wall Street doesn‚Äôt like change. This is big change. Of course, GOEV stock is going to be weak.

But long-term investors would be wise to work through this weakness, and stay the course.

Canoo will emerge from these changes as a stronger company, and long-term, this company will turn into a major player in both the consumer and commercial EV markets.

Bottom Line on GOEV Stock

GOEV stock represents one of the most compelling long-term plays on the ‚ÄúNext-Gen Mobility‚Äù revolution, wherein the world is pivoting from legacy gas-powered cars to self-driving EVs.

But Canoo is just one of my top electric vehicle stocks, which represent the cream-of-the-crop when it comes to disruptive technological innovation in EVs. These companies all feature second-to-none management teams and massive long-term potential.

Each of these next-generation mobility stocks could post Tesla-like returns, including a secret startup that‚Äôs spearheading the self-driving revolution, and a company I consider my EV ‚Äúsleeper‚Äù stock of the decade.

[All of this could be yours for less then $1 a call that expires in 192 days on an extremely volatile asset. ](https://preview.redd.it/d6c9i59ukd471.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1242a5d25cc794fd9383b8044df6e1733a171b5)

What if I told you that there is a stock on the market right now with an extremely low float of 17.5 million, a short percentage of 20%, has shot up over 200% in the past (January with GME), is about to break out, and has exceptionally cheap options expiring in 191 days?

If any of that made sense to you then buckle up buddy because here we go.

# Chart and Option Chain for December 2021:

[Notice the 4 month sideways action. ](https://preview.redd.it/gv242ecdnd471.png?width=1442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0f1b3cd54abaae35317089ceffe08c91da5004d)

Above is the 1 day moving chart on Tootsie-Roll. Notice that in January of this year $TR shot up 200% on the coattails of GME (citation: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/tootsie-roll-at-record-highs-as-shorted-stocks-get-trader-love](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/tootsie-roll-at-record-highs-as-shorted-stocks-get-trader-love)). Since then it has been steadily bouncing in the range of $30-$35 and as a result the **implied volatility on the option chain has plummeted, as a result options are dirt cheap.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Look at the prices for options with a 191 days to expiration on TR](https://preview.redd.it/x44du53ynd471.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dec06c930c19c8b84a2ca68551070a5be2dddefd)

**I need to be clear, people are selling options on an asset that has previously slapped-clapped sellers for pennies.** Further, Tootsie Roll has a so little shares available that it moved 4% on 700k volume today (06/10/2021). Imagine what happens when it starts to get a little volume.....

See below picture for a breakdown of the stock's technical stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

[Short percentage of 21&amp;#37; \(probobly higher\) with an already micro float. LOL](https://preview.redd.it/iu23sy9epd471.png?width=905&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de2cc48894fab0e0bc7b26cb48a4c0da0ae7f885)

Its not all about the options however. Since Tootsie has been trending between $30-$35 for the past couple months your downside right now is around $5 a share or 15%. We know that TR has a history of running crazy amounts in the past but has never really had the limelight put on it; when GME ran in January TR went through the roof as a pairs trade. The real question is why has it flown under the radar for so long.

Finally, Tootsie has kept under the radar for the past couple months. Recently it has started to make the rounds on WSB again (Citation see: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvctac/tootsie\_roll\_tr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvctac/tootsie_roll_tr/)).

# Conclusion:

***Cotton Candy, Sweet and Low, let me tell you why I'm in Tootsi-Roll.***

* For pennies you can get contracts that expire literally in 6 months. Say goodbye to theta decay.
* Tootsie has a low float, high short percentage, and is steadily climbing.
* Tootsie is going to break out.
* Tootsie has a track record of exploding.
* Tootsie's sideways action has crippled implied volatility and options are going at a discount to what they should be. (ALPHA)
* Your downside is $5 a share while your upside is massive.

Im in on $50 strike calls expiring in December of 2021 (191 days to exp) for .85 each. Further, I hold shares at $34.81

**I am not a financial advisor, nor is this financial advice. I just really like the stock, and no matter how much you try to hide from Tootsie Rolls you always end up eating one, so it seems like a good investment to me.**

TLDR: 

Tootsie-Roll has a extremely low float, high short %, low risk for buying shares ($30), and low price of options currently (40%IV). It is about to experience a breakout and has a track record of running hard. "|wallstreetbets|Why I decided to buy Tootsie Roll ($TR). (Proper DD)|20.0|0.64

1. Huge short interest as % float. In BBBY, it's 32%. That's a shit-ton of bananas if this thing pops. Keep in mind, that's just the official percentage. We all remember how GME was supposedly not being shorted anymore, right?  ü§°  Here is the short as % of float in BBBY's competitors:   
GAP = 6%  
TGT = 2%  
WMT = 1%
2. Forward-looking P/E. Now, I know division requires more toes and fingers than you've got (you might have to use your wife's boyfriend's), but take my word for it: forward-looking price/earnings ratio is a pretty fucking big deal. The lower it is, the more reasonably the stonk is priced. With BBBY, it's 16. With its competitors:  
GAP = 14  
TGT = 19  
WMT = 22
3. Last but not least, fucking Cramer... I know he's an amoral piece of shit manipulator with access to tens of millions of boomers. I know he tried to fuck us over on GME and other stonks waaaay too many times. But at the same time, he's pumping up BBBY like there's no tomorrow. Did you know that BB spiked up from $8 on zero actual news? The catalyst (that's a thing that makes a rocket go BOOM) was some CNBC guest quickly saying he had some BB calls. The whole thing was just 10 seconds long, but it set off a spike to $10, and the rest was history. If a simple 10-second segment can do that to a grotesquely over-shorted stonk... All I'm saying is that I anticipate a boomer stampede to BBBY sooner rather than later.

 Just like most of the other people posting about it here lately, I don't really know anything at all about the company **Cleveland-Cliffs ($CLF)**. That being said, I think its safe bet based on the name though that it has something to do with both the city of Cleveland and also (obviously) cliffs.  
&amp;nbsp;  
While I can't tell you much about **$CLF**, I can tell you quite a bit about the city of Cleveland and the wonderful geological features known as ""cliffs"", and why I am bullish as fuck on both of those.  
&amp;nbsp;  
#Fundamentals  
I know for most of you WSB newcomers you may be used to trading on emotions and memes, but its important to look at the fundamentals as well, so before we get to the memes lets start with some fundamentals and important background information.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Cleveland:**   

- Founded July 22, 1796 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland#History)) 
- Cleveland is the second largest city in the state of Ohio with a population of 381,009 ([source](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/clevelandcityohio))
- Cleveland  had a 2019 GDP of $118.17 Billion, up ~$1.5b from 2018, and nearly $13b since 2009. ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/514232/gdp-forecast-of-the-cleveland-metro-area/))  
- As of 2021 Cleveland has an annual budget of $1.8 billion ([source](https://www.wksu.org/government-politics/2021-03-16/cleveland-city-council-passes-1-8-billion-budget))
&amp;nbsp;  

**Cliffs:**

 - A cliff is a mass of rock that rises very high and is almost vertical, like a wall
([source](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/cliff/))  
 - Cliffs have been around for hundreds of millions of years, and show no signs of going anywhere anytime soon. Fossils dating back 313 million years have been found inside of cliffs. ([source](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/grand-canyon-cliff-collapse-fossil-footprints-scn-trnd/index.html))  
 - Cliffs are known for forming major geographical features such as waterfalls. ([Source](http://justfunfacts.com/interesting-facts-about-cliffs/))  
 - Cliffs are the sole required equipment for the popular sport of cliff jumping ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_jumping))  
&amp;nbsp;  

#Indications of Substantial Short Interest

Now unfortunately **the SEC does not regulate municipalities or geological features** thus hedgefunds **are not required to report their short positions in these areas**. That said there are certainly some major indicators that these funds likely have **significant short positions** in both Cleveland and cliffs.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Cliffs:**  

 - The sport of ""Freestyle Cliff Jumping"" emerged in the 21st century, and has exploded in popularity. So much so that Redbull even now hosts a global cliff diving world series. ([source](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/event-series/redbull-cliffdiving)). Despite this clear rise in popularity of cliff related sporting, we have not seen a correlated expansion in the number of cliffs in the world. This is clearly a sign that the growth rate of cliffs is being heavily suppressed by short sellers.   
 - Cliffs are eroding at increasing rates. As of 2016 it was found that **England's famous white cliffs have been eroding at 10 times their previous rate** over the past 150 years ([source](https://phys.org/news/2016-11-england-white-cliffs-dover-eroding.html)). 150 years before 2016 was 1866. What could have happened in England in 1866 to kick off this increased erosion of cliffs? In 1866 the bank Overend, Gurney and Company took on substantial investments in long-term investments rather than holding short-term cash reserves as was necessary and found itself in a liquidity crisis that bankrupted the company leading to a financial collapse known the ""Panic of 1866"" in England ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overend,_Gurney_and_Company)). That begs the question, what were these investments that caused them such trouble? Could it be that they were illegally naked shorting the white cliffs? The timeline makes too much sense to ignore. The continued increased deterioration rates of these cliffs indicate that its likely still going on. Overend, Gurney and Compnay may have failed but certainly someone further up the chain took over their positions (Think of what we saw recently with Melvin Capital and Citadel)

&amp;nbsp;  
**Cleveland:**  

 - Despite Cleveland's solid fundamentals, year to year growth of more than $1.5b and growth of $13b since 2009, Clevelands overall **economic growth ranks 2nd to last** among the 66 largest cities in the United States. ([source](https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/cleveland/wallethub-cleveland-slow-growing-city-survey/95-c99dafef-9398-4606-bea1-e1d1ce2da0c8)) **clearly short sellers are hammering this great city into the ground**.  
 - The 2011 hit movie ""[Kill The Irishman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_the_Irishman)""? Filmed in and based on events in the city of Cleveland. Who's the head of notorious short selling hedgefund **Citadel**? None other than **Ken Griffin**. Where's the surname Griffin popular? Griffin is a surname of **Irish**, English and Welsh origin ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_\(surname\))). Now we don't want to go full blown conspiracy nut here, but this looks like a pretty clear signal from the city of Cleveland that they want some serious revenge on our boy Ken Griffin. They must know that we own the entire float and there is illegal naked short selling going on.  

&amp;nbsp;  
#üöÄüöÄüöÄ To The Moon?  üåö

Even if we completely ignore the obvious short interest in both Cleveland and cliffs, if we look closely, they're both clearly trying to speak to us about an upcoming moonshot. At the end of the day it's really just like Ryan Cohen and DFVs incredibly obvious hints in their tweets.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Cliffs:**  

 - Trivia time. Where is the largest cliff in the solar system? Yup. Already waiting for us on the god damn moon üåö. Uranus' moon Miranda to be specific. The Verona Rupes cliff is estimated to be a whopping 12 miles high. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona_Rupes)) nothing says ""üöÄüöÄüöÄ cliffs to the üåö"" like a giant cliff on an actual moon. We're not even talking just earth's moon, we're talking a moon over 1.6 billion miles away.  
&amp;nbsp;  

**Cleveland:**  

 - Cleveland, Ohio is designated as a **GAMMA+** city by the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute ([source](https://www.spottedbylocals.com/blog/alpha-beta-and-gamma-cities/)).    
 - NASA's üöÄüöÄüöÄ Glenn Research Center is based in Cleveland. They specialize in space propulsion and cryogenic fluids management. Their website is literally people (apes?) on the moon ([source](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/home/index.html)).   
 - Where does Cleveland's NBA team the Cavaliers play? That's right. **ROCKET üöÄüöÄüöÄ MORTGAGE FIELDHOUSE**. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Mortgage_FieldHouse)).   
&amp;nbsp;  

#Potential Upcoming Catalysts
 
What kind of üöÄüöÄüöÄ fuel could be coming up to Cleveland and cliffs to the üåö? It could be anything but here are some potential catalysts I've found in my research.   
&amp;nbsp;  
**Cliffs:**  

 - Global Warming. Melting glacial ice and rising sea levels may unintuitively actually benefit cliffs. Sure, existing cliffs may face increased rates of erosion but said erosion also has the potential to create new cliffs as well. Everyone knows that hip new cliff is way cooler than a boring hundred million year old cliff. Now new cliffs being created by erosion from rising sea levels will likely take thousands of years, but melting glacial ice could also provide a shorter term catalyst. **For all we know there may be some fantastic cliffs hidden under all of that ice.** Ice melting away to reveal previously unknown cliffs could be a massive catalyst.  
&amp;nbsp;  

**Cleveland:**  

 - Return of the King üëë? LeBron James has 2 years left on his contract with the Lakers. When it ends he will be 38 years old and likely at or nearing retirement. It would only be fitting for him to come back to Cleveland where it all started to finish up his career. **The return of LeBron would be a massive financial boon for the city of Cleveland**, likely blowing short sellers out of the water and inducing game ending **margin calls üöÄüöÄüöÄ**.  

 - The Hyperloop Project. There are plans in place for a hyperloop train between Cleveland and Chicago that could cover the 300+ miles in only 28 minutes. Recently plans were announced to expand this project to connected Cleveland and New York as well. ([source](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/cleveland-hyperloop-project-eyes-expanding-route-to-include-new-york-city-in-early-phase)). **Having such quick/easy access to two of countries largest cities could be a huge draw to living in the city of Cleveland.**  
&amp;nbsp;  

**$CLF:**  

 - WSB apes taking an obvious shitpost too seriously and actually buying a stock because of it. ([source](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/08/investing/wendys-reddit-wallstreeetbets/index.html))

I was like most everyone else, thinking that Nikola is dead.

With scandal after scandal, the writing was on the wall: The proposed factory out in Arizona where there were no building permits pulled from the city, the girl taking the video several weeks after the groundbreaking and no work had been done, the rolling the truck down an incline for a promo video, the powering the demo truck with a non-hydrogen engine for the special even where Tesla enthusiasts were invited by Trevor Milton to come see for themselves, the truck orders that had no legal binding but were presented as real orders... The list goes on and on and on.

They have no factory, no prototype, no product. They were done... or are they?


I was doing some research back into the company and came across the following (job listing)[https://nikolamotor.com/careers/jobs/test-532]

Twenty years ago, HP‚Äôs market value was 10 times that of Apple, but now Apple‚Äôs market value is 60 times that of HP. HP is the founder of Silicon Valley, and its history is much longer and more brilliant than Apple. The following recommended reasons for purchase:

1. HP‚Äôs printer business still has a lot of room for development, especially 3d printing technology. Its personal computers, servers, and tablets are all developing well.
2. HP is the true representative of Silicon Valley, which has influenced generations of Americans and even people all over the world
3. HP‚Äôs current price-to-earnings ratio is 10. Apple‚Äôs is close to 30. Even if it‚Äôs just comparing hardware, HP is cheaper.
4. HP‚Äôs option prices are now very cheap. If you want to get quick returns, HP‚Äôs short-term and long-term options can be considered.

Because you have no fucking clue why you‚Äôre investing in it outside of group-think. 

Spoiler alert: virtually none of the companies being spammed on this sub over the last week make any fucking money. Go for it, look up their last earnings report and look at how much money they shat down the drain.

That‚Äôs why they have short interest in excess of 20% - they‚Äôre SHIT COMPANIES.

Trading them is a fucking shot in the dark - sure, it might go up based off retail buy pressure, gamma ramp, or a short getting margin called elsewhere in their account - but if it does YOU GOT LUCKY. 

These are shit companies, and guess what happens if you don‚Äôt get the market mechanics you‚Äôre looking for?

You‚Äôre bag holding a shit company.

There are literally two companies with traction on this sub that turn a profit, $UWMC and $CLF.

UWMC looked good months ago, same time RKT did - only since then housing starts have dropped three months in a row, and the imminent collapse of homebuyer sentiment is dinner-table conversation in every suburb your mom has a boyfriend. Share price valuations are forward-looking, and the outlook for UWMC is not overly positive, no matter what the half-assed DD you read here said.


**CLF has the exact opposite macro-outlook.** Steel prices have tripled in the past year, with industry overheads remaining largely stable save for the price of Iron Ore, which has also ran up significantly. Fortunately, CLF produces their own Iron Ore, **so they are literally shitting out money as they reap the benefits of vertical integration.** 

Steel prices are **the highest they‚Äôve ever been** - nearly every single steel company is going to report their greatest quarter in history this summer. But most importantly:

**STEEL PRICES ARE GOING TO STAY HIGH.** Why?

- **Chinese steel accounts for 15-20%** of the global export market, and they‚Äôve all but stopped exporting - they eliminated Tax rebate incentives for steel producers last month in a bid to keep supply grounded domestically for their own affordable infrastructure stimulus and carbon emissions goals, and have been floating rumors of an export tax the past two weeks. 15% of the worlds export tonnage drying up is HUGE - the leftover demand will NEED to come from somewhere.

Additionally, the 2022 Beijing olympics are around the corner, and who remembers what china did in an effort to combat smog prior to the 2008 games? They shuttered steel production in Beijing/Hebei, one of the largest steel producing provinces. Less Chinese steel = higher ex-China prices.

- **Nations using infrastructure-as-stimulus post-covid.** Bidens infrastructure bill is coming down the pipe. China issued a $500 Billion package as well, and they‚Äôre being floated in parliaments across South America, Asia, and Europe as we speak.

- **Industry consolidation.** Competition and supply gluts are what eventually kill commodity runs - but the US and European steel industries have consolidated into significantly fewer hands since the last steel bull run. The current CLF is the product of the 2020 acquisitions of Arkansas Steel and ArcelorMittal USA, taking two independent drivers off the table.

**In addition to the boatload of macroeconomic tailwinds the steel industry writ-large is experiencing, 
there are also CLF specific advantages.**

- **GOES.** CLF is the sole American producer of Grain-Oriented Electric Steel (GOES), which is necessary for transformers, generators, and other grid elements necessary for the transition to renewables.

- **Vertically Integrated.** Discussed earlier, CLF is equal parts Iron Ore Miner and Steel producer.

- **High short interest.** on the order of 20%. I truly do not understand the shorts thesis AT ALL. Yes CLF is leveraged due to recent acquisitions, but they are printing money. Literally printing it.

**For perspective: CLF is an $11 Billion company that is projected to earn $4 Billion in earnings this year. AMC is a $25 Billion company that earned $0.77 Billion in 2019, PRE-Pandemic.**

I trimmed my CLF for other steel companies over the last couple weeks and am regretting it now that WSB is finally aware of the shares on loan %.

CLF‚Äôs fair valuation relative to CURRENT industry peers based on forward EBITDA, book value, and managements forecasts on debt pay down would put CLF squarely in $30-40 / share range. That‚Äôs not even counting continued sector growth over the coming year, that‚Äôs just **fair value right now.**

Fair value returns at 50%-100% even BEFORE meme/squeeze returns is a hell of a lot safer of a bet than UWMC, BB, AMC, GME, CLNE, CLOV, or whatever the hell else ill-advised prayer play I‚Äôve seen here the past week.

**TLDR: CLF is pretty much the only WSB short interest play with limited fundamental downside; they‚Äôre shitting money, and have enough macroeconomic tailwinds to entertain a supply chain logistics class for a semester.**

 If you think it‚Äôs late for CLF you‚Äôre probably not aware of the industry landscape or the company‚Äôs footing in it.

**What is a Gap?:** Gaps are seen throughout stocks in where price opens and closes at a farther away price. In this example, we can see a gap in late February 2021 in where price dropped from about $50 to $33 without a candle in between. The space between the candles is referred to as a gap.

**What is a Gap Fill?:** It is common for these gaps in price to be ""filled"" at a later date. What this means is that price usually comes back to the gap at a later date to test the liquidity at those prices. A gap fill can be seen in the above example on November 2019 (Gap) and February 2020 (Fill).

**Technical Analysis:**

* Break and retested long-term $34.00 support/resistance level
* Daily candle held above $34 and primed to fill the gap to $50
* Volume steadily increasing along with increasing price (bullish)
* Low Float with only 23M Shares available to trade with. (vs GME at 57M. Extremely volatile moves possible)

However, Gamestop's schedule 14A that was filed earlier today makes it clear that this is not the case. Insiders are allowed to vote as well so the total vote cap is 70M. Since 55M votes were cast (78%), it was no where near 100% and there is no reason to ""trim"" or ""normalize"" votes.

Sooooo an insider recently bought 50,000 more shares of UWMC. By recently, I mean Monday and Tuesday of THIS WEEK. Robert Verdun bought 25,000 shares on 6/7 at 9.1 and 25,000 more shares on 6/8 at 9.15, yesterday. 

Today the stock jumps 9%!!! Coincidence?

Mr. Verdun is such an insider that any trades he makes require a special report to the SEC.

https://sec.report/CIK/0001841894/Insider-Trades

But Mr. Verdun is not just any insider - he is a member of the board of directors.

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UWMC/company-people

https://investors.uwm.com/governance/board-of-directors/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=f8e70ac0-b851-451d-8411-975c6d81464c

As you can see, Robert Verdun is no ape. He also bought 60,000 shares back on 3/3/2021 - at 7.97 share price!

But it‚Äôs this week‚Äôs purchases which are most interesting. 
$227,500 (25,000 x 9.1) plus $228,750 (25,000 x 9.15) means his 50,000 shares, a $456,240 investment is now worth $500,000 just a day later!!!

Why is this so important?
Well, what happened right before 6/7? Like, the business day before that?

That was the day of a little something called the preliminary initial Russell inclusion list. On the preceding Friday, 6/4, UWMC didn‚Äôt make the cut by a technicality. Surely there was communication with Russell about this. Is it likely Mr. Verdun knew something on 6/7 and 6/8, prior to the share price SPIKE ON 6/9?

The board is not only the entity who approved the share buyback, but also would be intimately involved with the communication with Russell. And Mr. Verdun is one of the few people who MIGHT know a little something about that.

Maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence. Maybe. Or maybe Friday will bring us even more good news!

Today is just the beginning! LFG!!!

First of all I want to [link this post that explains the price action that CLNE needs to reach it‚Äôs target price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns9i8r/clne_only_needs_moderate_price_action_over_next/) (which it is currently already at) in order to trigger shorts, which is $13. We only need to buy and hold for nearly a week for this to happen. Look up any previous DD post on CLNE where they explain the reason it is being shorted (revenue growth is expected in the medium to long term so it looks like easy money for hedge funds). [Here is a link with short interest over the past year for anyone lazy](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clne/short-interest).

CLNE also has several partnerships in the works including a large deal to provide RNG (carbon renewable natural gas) to Amazon for their delivery trucks, and in general green energy is growing priority for the USA and the world in general. As someone who is probably most risk averse than most people here, this makes me feel better as I can always hold in case of a sudden dip for longer term gains.

I also did some more research after reading some of the more surface level posts on CLNE and found that they built their stations near existing Amazon warehouses, which gives them an advantage when negotiating future deals as transportation of materials is factored into negotiations (from what I know, I work as a software engineer for a steel manufacturing business).

CLNE has also not even reached it‚Äôs all time high of $16 yet (even with a 8.5% after hours gain), whereas most of the other meme'd stocks have well surpassed their's and are in the pump-and-dump territory that leads to a lot of paper handing. Not blaming anyone, gains are gains.

Volume picked up heavily at the end of today as attention shifted away from some of the shorter plays. I‚Äôve held a small stake since I read [this article back in April](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210419005219/en/Clean-Energy-Signs-Agreement-with-Amazon-for-Low-and-Negative-Carbon-RNG), however I‚Äôve added more as the meme potential has built up as this subreddit is starting to have a lot of influence I‚Äôm wishing I put more than 10k in but gains are gains, and hopefully you learned something from this. Just trying to bring some more serious discussion to the chaos of the last couple weeks haha.

AMC had an absolutely incredible bullish move supported by technicals and volume (and shorts and gamma). It now looks to be creating a failure swing (lower high). You can see on the backside here we've lost the parabola and the bullish trendline. Volume is not supportive of this bounce. You can see that volume has declined on this bounce vs the increasing volume that we saw on the initial rally. RSI / MACD are rolling over.

The one thing I will say about AMC vs GME or BB right now is there are 125,000 calls in the money expiring next week on AMC at the $40 strike. If it's able to hold the $40 level into next week we might see another gamma move. For now though it looks like bears have control. Based on this setup I would expect we end the week pretty close to that big $32 level. If we lose $32 we should head towards $14.

I do have a position against AMC which you can see in my previous posts.

1623288672.0|0.0|t3_nwbqv5|194.0|"Hey Ya! Remember the early 2000s? It was all about lace-up jeans, giant cargo shorts, Gilmore Girls, Lord of the Rings, the Atkins Diet ... and the BlackBerry.

Long before the iPhone, the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe, known especially for its reliability, its security, and its full keyboard. But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn't change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention ‚Äî first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.

And that's where we see a major opportunity.

BlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You've heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle ""the Enterprise of Things."" BlackBerry's new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn't fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it's securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.

If your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.

Second Bloom!

It's no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 ‚Äî and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.

But this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.

BlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.

But the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.

The company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.

This certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021. 

Still Green!

That hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.

Since being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).

Add it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.

Risks and When We'd Sell!

There are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&amp;D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.

The company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors ‚Äî companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others ‚Äî have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.

The Foolish Bottom Line!

Not every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is ""largely done reinventing itself"" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know ‚Äî he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.

Whether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected ""things"" safe and secure. The best part is that many investors can't see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past.

-25-30% (of revenue) Cost of goods sold

-40-45% sales and marketing expense

-8-9% Gen and Admin expense

This implies long term net income margins of 16-27%. Analysts believe they will continue to grow revenue by 20-25% per year over the next several years.

Looking out 5 years to 2026 if we assume conservatively: 

-19% annual revenue growth from 2021 projected $3.2 billion 

-15% net income margin in 2026

-We get $7.64 billion in revenue and $1.146 billion non gaap net income. Put a conservative p/e multiple on that and you can see that the fundamentals will be dragging the share price much much higher over time.   

Finally, Future growth opportunities from Wish‚Äôs investor relations website:


Multiple growth opportunities with new product expansion
* Wish Local opens up large growth opportunity
* Consumer goods and branded product expand catalog
* Open Wish platform for logistics and marketing as a service

Some notes on the above.. Wish local allows brick and mortar retail shops to store wish inventory for very low cost, unlike expensive Amazon fulfillment center real estate. The retail store gets the benefit of potential new customers walking in their door to pick up wish packages, they have the option to deliver the package for wish (for compensation), and they get to upload their own inventory to wish‚Äôs platform to reach a global customer base. This also helps wish reduce shipping times. It‚Äôs a win win. There were over 55,000 wish local partners as of Q1. 

Wish is focusing on getting more expensive (branded) products on the platform because they note it‚Äôs more profitable to sell higher priced goods, or at least multiple cheap goods in one delivery. They‚Äôre focusing marketing strategy on retaining high Life Time Value customers, as opposed to people that buy once and never return. 

Their logistics revenue grew 300% in 2020 to over $500 million. This logistics segment alone is worth far more than the current market cap. Logistics margins aren‚Äôt as profitable as market place or product boost (advertising revenue), but their logistics margins are improving and will be a profit center In a couple more quarters. 

Please read the Q4 2020, Q1 2021 shareholder letters. 

Not financial advice. Full disclosure I‚Äôm long the stock (obviously) and very bullish.

CLOV SEC Filings/Recent Releases/Events: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/investor-relations](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/investor-relations)

\_\_\_

**Common Questions and Concerns (Sources numbered at the bottom):**

**Q:** **Clover Health has 80/90/100%+ institutional ownership! This is very clearly a collaboration by the hedge funds to earn back their lost money from shorting GME/AMC/BB/(insert any other ticker here) right?**

**A:**  Institutional ownership =/= shorts.

Institutions decide if they are shorting a position or holding for the long haul. CLOV isn't just a meme stock, they are a disruptor in the Medicare advantage field with promising and improving results quarter after quarter. They were added to the MSCI index in May**^(1)** and are being added to the Russell 3000 index on June 25th at market close**^(2)**.

CLOV has had a high short interest for months**^(3)** driving the price down from $17 in December 2020 to bottoms of $6 making this a prime long pick for non-shorting institutions in the intermediary time between then and now. Citadel isn't even in the top ten for institutional ownership**^(4)**. Do you know who is in the top ten? Vanguard and Blackrock, both very well-known for investing in to companies most likely to be successful.

Number one in institutional CLOV holdings? Greenoaks Capital. ""***Greenoaks Capital believes a small handful of high-quality technology companies define each generation. Their mission is to identify those companies early in their life cycle and partner with them for decades.***"" **^(5)**

\_\_\_

**Q:** **Citadel owns 500,000 shares of CLOV, this must be a distraction scheme to cover their positions for AMC/GME/BB/(insert any other ticker here) right?**

**A:** Citadel DID indeed own 500,000 shares of CLOV as of 03-31**^(6)**‚Äî Citadel also happens to have been holding over 700,000 shares of AMC as of the same date**^(7)**. Citadel owns approximately 0.45% of the entire existing non-shorted float of CLOV. Shorting Institutions often hold long and short positions at the same time. This is a normal occurrence.

\_\_\_

**Q:** **Clover Health only has 4 employees according to Robinhood! Why is this company worth anything AT ALL?**

**A:** Clover Health has over 450 employees listed on LinkedIn**^(8)** and they operate in 8 states nationwide (Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas)**^(9)** **and they even have an office in Hong Kong** **^(10)**. Clover Health has been involved in Medicare Advantage since 2014. Robinhood has faulty data.

And once again, I am asking for proof of naked shorting happening. ""Well but it CAN happen"" yes and you could also skin a dog and then take his skin and perfectly fit it around your dog to make a doggy zoot suit, but that doesn't mean it happens!



In fact, I'm being convinced day by day that most of you don't even understand the difference between an equity and a derivative and think naked shorting options is naked short selling. It isn't.



So once again: any proof? With how ""widespread"" it is, shouldn't be too difficult to pony up a single screenshot, right?




Ready.............aaaaand GO!!!

This isn‚Äôt a pie in the sky hopes and dreams play like Nikola ‚Äì these guys have 5 models of electric boats in production and back orders for the next 2 years. They have also created the worlds fastest outboard electric motor capable of taking a boat 80 mph (who would want to go that speed on the water I don‚Äôt know).

This is a great Green Energy angle because their boats create no pollution, there is no noise as you get with the gas engines and they can go for 10 hours before needing another charge.

The company is called Vision Marine Technologies and they trade on Nasdaq.

There are also rumors that they have been coming under a huge short attack for months.

The borrow fees for the stock are running at 60%.

Apparently a small number of shares were coming free trading, but there is a holdup. Shorts were relying on this to cover their position ‚Äì now they are screwed.

One of the reasons I love this play is because three major trends are converging here:¬†

1) ¬†the green transformation underway is a $40 trillion endeavor and there‚Äôs no stopping it. ¬†

2) ¬†the overall boat market is projected to hit $27 billion a year, while sales of electric boats and motors are set to triple in just three years.¬†

3) ¬†all the waterways are going electric. There is a huge effort underway to transform the vast US Marine Highway Network into an electric bonanza. 

These guys have been building electric boats for years already. They‚Äôve been selling them for years already.

Their leap into the wildly profitable EV segment isn‚Äôt speculative at all. They already have the fastest outboard electric motor in the world. They outperform everything else by a nautical mile.

There‚Äôs no waiting for these to become a reality, as with Nikola. These boats are already here and ready to disrupt right off the dock.

By 2019, Vision Marine had the fastest electric boat in existence, at 31 mph on the quarter-mile.

The boats have already captured the fancy of the sailing world, but here‚Äôs what captured my attention: What powers them and the massive amount of value behind the tech and IP ...

Vision Marine has developed the world‚Äôs first-ever 180 HP electric propulsion engine.

It‚Äôs the E-Motion, and it‚Äôs not just an electric coup for the boating industry--it‚Äôs completely disruptive. It changes everything.

So, this isn‚Äôt just a story about a pipeline of e-boats.

It‚Äôs a story about a pipeline of E-boats plus a world-first proprietary electric powertrain that won‚Äôt just power Vision Marine‚Äôs legendary designed boats ‚Ä¶

They plan to power an entire world of e-boats.

I am long and think this could be a big name in the future. Also lets crush some shorts."|wallstreetbets|Vision Marine Technologies ‚Äì Under the radar stock with a huge naked short|4.0|0.56

After months of shorting by hedge funds and bears bashing the company. I believe this stock is about to breakout into a new all time high over the coming weeks.

Let‚Äôs take a look at the several companies ideanomics owns: WAVE, Timios, MEG, US Hybrid, Medici, Treelectric, Solectrac and Energica. 

Powering the Largest Wireless Fleet in the U.S.
WAVE‚Äôs high power wireless charging systems offer a modular solution (125kW to 500kW) across a broad range of commercial applications, including mass transit, ports, warehouse and distribution centers. The largest electric mass transit bus fleet in the US is powered by WAVE.

Accelerating Commercial EV Adoption in China
MEG competes in China using its Sales-to-Financing-to-Charging model (S2F2C), helping commercial fleet operators find the best vehicle for their needs and delivering solutions with innovative financing and charging technologies.

America‚Äôs First Manufacturer of Electric Tractors
With a range of 100% battery powered tractors, Solectrac is leading the transition to zero emission agriculture and utility operations with best-in-class technology for a safer, cleaner and healthier future.

Real Estate Reimagined
Timios seamlessly provides an unparalleled real estate transaction experience, making every step simple to manage and stress-free.

The World‚Äôs Leading Manufacturer of High-Performance Electric Motorcycles
Energica has combined zero emission EV technology with the pedigree of high-performance mobility synonymous with Italy‚Äôs Motor Valley to create a range of exceptional products for the high-performance motorcycle market.

Unlocking Medium- and Heavy-Duty EV
Medici is working with strategic partners to provide commercial fleet operators more vehicle options in the US and beyond.

Shaping the Future of Sustainable Micromobility
Malaysian EV maker with a strong focus on electric scooters and motorbikes has been a key leader in promoting electric mobility in the ASEAN region, and other parts of the world.

US Hybrid Corporation specializes in the design and manufacture of power conversion systems for medium and heavy-duty electric, hybrid, and fuel cell commercial buses and trucks to enable them to become more reliable and fuel-efficient, with lower emissions and better responsiveness.

Ideanomics revenue has a higher growth rate compared to its peers!!! Let‚Äôs look at Q1 2020: $32.7 million and gross profit of $10.8 million! An 8500% increase compared to Q1 2020! 
They also have $356 million cash on their balance sheet. 

Exciting news which could lead to a further breakout in the stock price: Ideanomics will be added to the Russel 3000 on June 25!

If this stock gets traction now we could see this pulling a AMC due to the company being undervalued and Heavily shorted!

Personally I think this stock can hit $7-$10 within the next couple of weeks."|wallstreetbets|$IDEX Is this undervalued EV company about to breakout to $7, Roth Capital says YES!|64.0|0.69

This week, we saw the boosts of CLOV, BB, GME, TLRY, WKHS, CLF and CLNE. One name has probably been in everyone‚Äôs peripheral vision: UWMC. 

Today was a mixed sentiment day with many of our tickers seeing pullbacks and folks taking profit. UWMC was able to weather the storm. In a full day session, UWMC not once dip below 6% green. It held strong even as the other popular ticker experienced sell downs. The reason for this is simple: it‚Äôs a GREAT company.

Here are just some highlights of upcoming catalysts:

1. Increasing short interest, 55% over the past few weeks. Despite the stellar performance over the last few days short interest went up.

2. Resilience to short attacks. Through the day there were several obvious short attempts to pull the down the stock but UWMC recovered instantly each time. This demonstrates an enormous pool of buyers with eyes locked.

3. Russell 2000 inclusion this Friday. I don‚Äôt think I need to point out the obvious benefits of ETFs in this play.

4. 4% Dividends will be distributed on July 6th. Many of these dividend distributions will find its way back into the stock.

5. 50K share insider purchase this morning. When memes go up, insiders sell. This is Not the case with UWMC. Insiders are buying! That‚Äôs how much management believes in the company.

6. There‚Äôs still the 300M share buyback that‚Äôs taking place while we ride.

Unfortunately, toward the end of the day, big money dumped into the short side of TLRY dragging the price down from highs. It is apparent that shorts are quadrupling their bets on this play, in an effort to oust longs. The risk levels must be very high for those in short positions, as we have heard nothing but good news for the MJ sector lately.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an indication of the ridiculous levels of short interest which has gradually increased:

[You can see the short volume reached the highest point today, compared to the last 3 months](https://preview.redd.it/umvxqkausb471.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e208f7ea454054fad088d2795da5919e176ada38)

&amp;#x200B;

Of all of the stocks talked about on this forum, I seriously cannot find one which compares to Tilray's level in pure terms of short volume. Over HALF the volume today was sold short yet we still ended in moderately positive territory. This set-up looks juicy for longs who want to join the train.

&amp;#x200B;

Update on the technical indicators: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vytp86qjtb471.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f4dcfcbc5935bf458e35a21b085b7a4d3defd57

Again, heavily favorable for long trades on the daily measurement. 

Moving averages are favorable 11:1

Technicals are favorable 8:1

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a sprint, it's a marathon. I believe due to the share structure + current unnecessary levels of short interest, we could see some violent price action on either the upside, or the downside. Brace for volatility folks, as the games on TLRY have just started.

Most casual observers never quite made the correlation, but if you live in Southern California and have driven to Las Vegas you‚Äôve driven over Mountain Pass. It's the last mountain range in the Mojave¬†Desert that you drive over on highway¬†15 just before you reach the state line of Nevada. Mountain Pass is the current only rare earth mining and processing site in the western hemisphere.¬†

**About rare earth metals** 

What are rare earth metals?¬†They are a group of 17 elements: lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium all found in rare deposits. The thing about these ‚Äúrare‚Äù metals is that they are actually quite common in the earth‚Äôs crust. However, the difficulties in the extraction process of these metals is what gives them their name. These metals are used in just about anything electronic, rechargeable batteries, magnets, computers, lasers, fiber optics, superconductors and vehicles. Not only are they used in electric vehicles in batteries and motors, but they are also used in catalytic converters. Over the last 5-6 years prices of rare earth metals have risen because they are ‚Äúrare‚Äù, but they are also very costly to refine in environmentally¬†friendly ways. This has also spurred the growth of catalytic¬†converter theft which has become a growing nuisance.¬†Recyclers have been paying up to $250 per unit to almost anyone that's¬†willing to supply them. Nearly 60% of rare earths metals that were imported in 2018 were used for catalytic converters.¬†

The majority of the global ‚Äúrare metal‚Äù supply is owned by China, thus they control most of the supply chain. Due to China‚Äôs dominance in this sector the United States, along with the rest of the world, is very susceptible to China‚Äôs pricing or supply disruption (tariffs/export ban/pricing pressure). According to this Reuters article, ‚ÄúThe United States imported $160 million of rare earth compounds and metals in 2018, up nearly 17% from 2017. Around 60% of it was used in catalysts for oil refining and in vehicle engines.‚Äù

**The SPAC merger**

On November 17, of 2020 Fortress¬†Value Acquisition¬†Corp (FVAC) closed a SPAC¬†merger deal with $345 Million in cash in trust and a $200 Million PIPE led by the SPAC King himself Chamath Palihapitiya. The combined company was set at a valuation of $1.5 Billion with over $500 million in cash to fund the growth strategy and was labeled¬†MP Materials.

**Government‚Äôs acceptance of clean energy and strengthening supply chains**

Over the term of the Trump presidency the trade war with China had intensified leaving companies with tariffs¬†and questionable supply chains. This economic¬†race had set the stage for MP Materials. With tariffs on imports and unfavorable pricing from China on rare earth materials it leaves a very volatile question mark for US manufacturers and other related companies. Flash forward to 2021 with the Biden administration, not only is the government trying to turn the table on strengthening its own supply chains, it's also trying to eliminate¬†its vulnerabilities. The pandemic has shown us the necessities of medicine, essential goods and things like semiconductors¬†should be made in the United States and this was reinforced by the executive order signed by President Biden in February. 

On the list of critical goods to be evaluated within the first 100 days was specifically rare earth metals. This clearly demonstrates how MP Materials being the only miner and refiner of these materials in the United States could profit. The other larger mention on the executive¬†order was large capacity batteries such as those used in electric cars. I would highly recommend reviewing the order as there are so many industries that were mentioned that all use rare earth metals related to MP Materials.

A long term investor may see the importance of rare earth metals in terms of being a critical factor to the US economy. After the 100 day review is completed somewhere around the beginning of June there is no doubt MP Materials will be listed as a critical¬†company and will have an overwhelming support of the US Government. Not only will this secure MP Materials as a local monopoly, but it will solidify local business supply chains for years to come. Also, with a critical infrastructure bill in the works the company could be on the list to receive subsidies to level the playing field with China. MP Materials‚Äô rare earth concentrate product represents 15% of the world‚Äôs supply.¬†

**Expected increase in demand of rare metals**

With the rise of electric vehicles starting to enter the manufacturing plants of US automakers the demand of rare earth metals will be growing *exponentially*. If you take a moment to look at the slide deck of the investor presentation from MP Materials, the business is currently in early days of stage 2. 

https://preview.redd.it/kulv811wlb471.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34781c5807e4acbd1efc78e1cab1e39b0c2942a4

&amp;#x200B;

MP Materials is mining NdPr materials (mainly Neodymium and Praseodymium), which power the **strongest types of rare earth magnets**. These magnets are used to power EVs (electric vehicles) and many industrial processes. This is why the mining of these rare earth metals play a vital role in the EV market. After mining these materials, MP Materials then **ships them to China** (they rely on plants in China to actually process the mined materials) while incurring a VAT tax and tariffs to be refined and is still turning a profit. MP Materials is set to open the largest NdPr separation facility in the world in 2022 and are putting stage II into motion. NdPr is an essential piece used in magnets especially in EV motors. Stage III shows they are looking to actually produce NdPr magnets onsite sometime past 2025 which would make them even more vertically¬†integrated.

Demand from electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other technologies is hitting an inflection point. The shift in clean energy and electrification of transport, globally, will be an important theme *over the next decade*. The demand for rare earths will rapidly outpace the current levels of production and supply. Take a look at the forecasted price of NdPr over the next several years.

&amp;#x200B;

From the MP Materials investor presentations, we‚Äôve pulled some of the charts where they forecast demand for electric vehicle magnets due to the high demand of EV sales compared to regular vehicle.

https://preview.redd.it/68g67d4zlb471.png?width=1662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aa89d60a1a43e2f1ab457332f469d7dbba09602

&amp;#x200B;

It is clear that this is not just a ‚Äúrare earth metal‚Äù play, but they will be particularly focused on NdPr which will be driven by clean energy industries, and more specifically electric vehicles.

**Potential Risks**

A company that entails rare earth mining, such as MP Materials, will be subject to typical risks that surround commodities. Right now we are in a ‚Äúsuper-cycle‚Äù, but how long will that last? Since China also supplies up to 80% of the world‚Äôs rare earth materials there is also the potential of risks associated with the pricing pressure. Lastly, there are some advancements in synthetically creating materials that replace these rare metals, but not enough conclusions have been drawn in the validity of this topic.

**Valuation**

Now like any SPAC it's hard to give accurate projections more than 3 years out, but the rare earth metal market has had prices nearly double this year which has led to a pretty sharp increase in the stock price already. Not to mention, unlike some SPACs this is a company that is already generating products and profits. The most recent analyst coverage has near term price targets between $37 and $57. In the last 3 weeks there has been a rise in the 10 Year yield and that has made the technology sector and SPACs become unfavorable. Like several other stocks, it appears MP Materials is the baby being thrown out with the bathwater, the stock has retraced from its $51.77 52-week high significantly. Now the company did report an¬†excellent 4th quarter surpassing expectations on March¬†18th. More recently the company announced it wanted to raise 600 million in a senior debt offering that would not come due until 2026. There was some concern that this could dilute the stock when it comes due, but this is over 5 years from now. This free cash will allow MP Materials to speed up its timeline and reduce costs by operating its own NdPr separation facility. With the speculation of a commodity¬†super cycle and rising inflation coming the¬†price of rare earth metals will continue to strengthen. This appears to be a potentially great value investment, and the upcoming 100 day review in June from the Biden administration will only further strengthen the importance of MP Materials in the US Economy.

Having said that, the company‚Äôs original valuation in the merger was set to 1 billion dollars (1.5 billion minus 500 million to fund expansions). At the moment of writing, the company‚Äôs market cap is sitting at roughly 6 billion. We want to determine if the current valuation is pricing the company at fair value, given the potential the company has. This is not an easy task given the complexities of the rare earth metal industry and also the lack of ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù. This is not a ‚Äúgrowth stock‚Äù, nor is it strictly a commodity play. In my opinion we can look at it as a play on Neodymium and Praseodymium (NdPr) which is where the pricing outlook and largest growth expected over the next 10 years is very strong. It is my opinion that MP Material‚Äôs growth will be somewhat reflected by the demand of the EV market as well as the progression of other clean energy industries where the use of these metals is critical. If the EV market were to increase tenfold, I think MP Materials would also benefit greatly by proxy.

**TLDR;**

1. China currently has somewhat of a monopoly on rare earth materials, currently providing about 80% of the world‚Äôs supply. This allows them the capability to create pricing pressure (which they have done in the past) and control the supply to hurt their competitors.
2. At this moment in time, MP Materials is currently mining the materials, then sending them off to China for processing all while still maintaining a profit. MP Materials will eventually be processing these rare earth materials in their own processing plants. The company is working on vertical integration for the entire process from start to finish.
3. The most significant of these metals is NdPr, which power some of the strongest magnets used specifically in the electric vehicles and wind turbines (clean energy).
4. MP Materials stock price is already trading at a hefty valuation relative to what the stock price was post-merger. However, this company‚Äôs revenues will also be reflected by the strong demand (and trend) driven by the increase in EV sales.
5. Considering these metals will play a vital role in many tech industries moving forward, they may receive substantial support from the government. The Biden administration has already put in motion a plan to strengthen it‚Äôs own supply chains to remove vulnerabilities. Rare earth metals are specifically on this list.

$SNDL is currently one of the most appealing stock picks with huge catalysts that are being underestimated or simply ignored  ‚Äî  understandable seeing the number of narratives floating around forums and MMS designed especially to drive your attention to what the big interests really want to.

&amp;#x200B;

# The company's financials

At the beginning of 2020, Sundial‚Äôs **new leadership** outlined their primary objectives:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To deliver industry-leading, best-in-class products with a focus on inhalables  
&gt;  
&gt;To de-risk \[their\] balance sheet and improve liquidity  
&gt;  
&gt;To increase \[their\] capacity utilization to unlock the value of our high-quality assets

With **$600M** of cash on balance, **$SNDL** is one of the best cannabis stocks from a financial point of view, not to mention they have **zero debt,** while its competitors (**$ACB, $TLRY**, etc.) are floating in halves of billions of debt.

&amp;#x200B;

[$SNDL long-term debt](https://preview.redd.it/nxxhogsc4b471.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecdd9393b9f5fdc05361809a80b1646cf8631656)

# 

# The big interests

Financial institutions' goal is to short the company and do everything possible to bankrupt it.

With many catalysts in sight, they seem to have targeted $SNDL when in Dec 2020 it had received an [extended 180-days grace period](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-receives-approval-for-nasdaq-listing-transfer-to-allow-for-additional-180-day-compliance-period-301191182.html) to maintain stock pricing levels above $1,00 or get delisted from the NASDAQ index at expiration.

It can be seen how short interest started to rise ever since elections (due to cannabis stocks hype), just to slingshot to over 300% by Q1 after the delisting announcement. It was their perfect catalyst for short sharks.

[$SNDL short interest quarterly](https://preview.redd.it/q0i77g3y1b471.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfca16ba4123116af2e91ab3c347d843ab28bb26)

# Why the short interest is declining

Financial institutions like hedge funds are purely about risk management, and some of them are looking at a possible **Q3 outperformance.** There are many reasons as to why, but in short, let's put a TL;DR bullet list:

&amp;#x200B;

* Top financials within the competitors
* Actively growing and expanding company, with constantly increasing revenue
* Imminent cannabis legalization
* General market recovery post C#VID

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong: fundamentally speaking, hedge funds do acknowledge that **$SNDL** is one of the **best cannabis companies**, however, they'd rather make 10x more money by shorting it and doing everything possible to bankrupt the company.

I am a scientist doing biological research, but I don't work in immunology or infectious diseases so I am by no means an expert. I have interacted with the founder of Inovio, Dr. David Weiner, briefly on a couple of occasions, but I have no knowledge that isn't publicly available and I am not affiliated with the company in any way. Finally, I am very bad at investing, so please do not take this as advice. I'm only making this because I think their tech is really cool and underappreciated and I think you'll find it cool too. Also if I happen to be right we could make some money.

# So what does Inovio do?

Inovio works on making DNA based treatments for a broad range of diseases. To boil it down to basics, when something bad is in your body, whether that's a bacteria, virus, or even a tumor, your immune cells recognize that bad thing by specific substances that the bad thing produces. We call those substances antigens. You might recognize this terminology and process from the recent COVID vaccines and mutations. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are both based on a COVID antigen known as the spike protein. Both of those vaccines use [RNA to give your cells instructions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mRNA.html) to make the protein and recognize it when you become infected. Inovio develops **DNA** injections to get to the same result. 

Inovio has been working on this since long before COVID was on our mind and they currently have [clinical trials](https://www.inovio.com/for-patients-clinical-trials/) ongoing to treat HPV, HIV, Hepatitis C, metastatic prostate cancer and of course, COVID-19. 

# So why is Inovio not just 3rd place finisher behind Pfizer/Moderna?

As I mentioned before, [Inovio's platform](https://www.inovio.com/dna-medicines-technology/) is based on DNA. You might remember from biology class that DNA has two strands, whereas RNA has one strand. One big advantage of storing instructions in DNA over RNA is that DNA is far more stable. If you know a biologist, ask them if they'd rather work with DNA or RNA. 99% are going to choose DNA, because RNA is incredibly unstable and has to be kept very cold or it will spontaneously degrade. You might have a faint recollection of problems storing and transporting the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines because they must be stored at -80 and once thawed, must be used in a short window of time. DNA on the other hand, can be dried and stored at [room temperature](https://ir.inovio.com/news-releases/news-releases-details/2020/INOVIO-Announces-Positive-Interim-Phase-1-Data-For-INO-4800-Vaccine-for-COVID-19/default.aspx) for extended periods of time (1 year+) without compromising its structure. 

So not only is Inovio ahead of the pack on development of non-COVID uses of this type of treatment, but their treatment is far easier to produce, store, and transport.

# So what's to prevent copycats?

One of the disadvantages of using DNA to deliver instructions to your cells is that it is harder to actually get DNA into cells. The way the COVID vaccines were injected would not be very effective using DNA. However, Inovio has developed a [proprietary handheld device](https://ir.inovio.com/news-releases/news-releases-details/2020/INOVIO-Receives-71-Million-Contract-From-US-Department-of-Defense-To-Scale-Up-Manufacture-of-CELLECTRA-3PSP-Smart-Device-and-Procurement-of-CELLECTRA-2000-for-COVID-19-DNA-Vaccine/default.aspx) that uses an electrical pulse to help the DNA get into your cells. They have fairly broad (in my opinion) patents covering both this device and their DNA technology in the [U.S.](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8927508B2/en) and [Europe](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP2409727A1/en) that don't expire until 2029 and 2027 respectively.

# So how do I make sweet sweet MONEY?

Inovio is well set up to capitalize on these emerging technologies beyond just COVID-19. I see two potential routes for big ROI. As previously mentioned, they have ongoing trials for multiple diseases that have previously been incurable or very difficult to treat. Based on the efficacy of the COVID vaccines and [published data](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00239-1/fulltext) by Inovio on their DNA technology, I believe these trials will be successful and open the door for this tech to be used against  wide variety of conditions from COVID to cancer. With their IP and head start, they should capitalize on this opportunity well.  Of course success of clinical trials is never a guarantee, but you have to risk money to make money, and Inovio seems to be on the right track for success. The second potential for huge growth of Inovio is another pandemic. It'd be nice not to have to hope for that, but data does suggest that we'll see them more frequently.

I see this as a growth stock with the potential for a large acquisition pending the success of their trials. The best value to me seems like shares and LEAPs, as catalysts for biotech companies often come quite suddenly. I occasionally buy 1 DTE options because I am a fool who no longer wishes to work.

# TL;DR: 

**Inovio (INO) has a way to potentially treat incurable diseases that is similar to the highly effective COVID-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer/Moderna. Inovio's treatments are stable at room temperature for a year and they have patents protecting their tech in the U.S. and Europe. Clinical trials look promising and upon success the company is poised for massive growth/acquisition.**"|wallstreetbets|I'm a scientist, here's why I'm bullish on Inovio (INO)|62.0|0.71

1623273411.0|0.0|t3_nw6lmm|416.0|"Since I saw a lot of misinformed comments in the daily threads, I figured I would share this information.

The current borrow fee rate for CLOV is 116.7% (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/clov). The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. 

The borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.

0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. 

Yesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. 

The shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please.

I currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%.

Obligatory rocket emojis üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here:

- The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex.

- https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze.

- questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%.

- Additionally https://www.shortsight.com/ shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.

By now WWE should be on everyones tendie radar after today's outsized move on large volume (6x the normal daily volume). The combination of low float (\~44M), high short interest (18-22%) and the sheer number of extremely memeable wrastling GIFs set this one up to be one for the history books. The options chain is also primed to explode. I could easily see this running back to the old ATHs within the next few months.

On top of that we have the return of live events next month in Texas and potential buyout rumors floating around adding fuel to the fire. This summer is setting up to be big for McMahon and his merry crew of men in leotards, we should all profit from this greatly.

Sports are coming back this fall and you can bet your bottom dollar that advertisers will be out in force trying to scoop up folks Biden bucks as they watch Football on their new big screen.

I‚Äôm not saying they are gonna unseat the king, but if you had the chance to invest in Netflix when it was more than 50% off all time highs, would you? 

Their balance sheet is pretty solid, they have seen continued quarterly growth and America loves a good come back story.

1. There were not many options strike prices until today max $22.. so the all the options were actually ITM.. if the prices stay at over 22. the underwriters are screwed next delivery day on 18june. So it's very important for them to keep prices suppressed. If the prices go over 22 and everyone exercises options next week will be a bloodbath.
2. if the hedgies survive next week. They will be a bit relaxed but will have to any which way but back the shares they had sold. This will cause price increase.

Another way to look at it.

Until today all the Call Strike prices available were $22 or below. Hence everyone who bought Calls will be in the money on 18June if prices are above $22. And even if people sell the options to someone else. Others would exercise the options. No one would leave ITM options to waste. i.e. every call optins will be exercised.

Imagine all the amount of options being exercised. What will it do the prices!!! Its to another GALAXY

HENCE its so much important for the prices to be lower than $22 at ANY COST for the hedgies and underwriters. 

This in fact is not even about fighting the hedgies. It's just that some one made a mistake of not writing more options.

1623270083.0|0.0|t3_nw5c9b|3.0|"$GE has 120,000 naked calls sold between $14 and $14.5 for 6/11. I‚Äôm not asking you beautiful apes to follow me to attempt a squeeze because it‚Äôll go up a few cents. This means that there are 12M shares to be covered if this closes above $14.5 on Friday. MMs are vulnerable which can be seen in the level two data. 

Statistically every morning 6M shares get shorted to dump the price. Before this was going on MMs left the price around $14 to get people to buy weekly calls thinking it‚Äôll pivot to a new leg. 

Naturally being the greedy assholes they are, after they sold 120,000 calls they tanked the price through a short attack. Ladder attacks typically involve two HFs working together to short and cover synthetic shares. This is just a huge short sell to stuff the price when volume is low in order. This is evident when you compare the volume in the first hours of trading to the last and the price action after hours. The stock always opens higher because all covering is done after hours where it can‚Äôt get momentum. 

Best play possible is to let the shorts sell tomorrow morning to shove the price down. Once that happens a simple pump to the green will force the shorts to double. This always happens. Every single rally is shorted and all the good news is shorted. So it will happen. Once the shorts bring resistance you pull support and let the shorts tank it harder. Once the shorts have over extended a final pump to $14 will lock in the shorts with no money to continue to borrow, force them to cover, and bring the naked calls into the money. The naked calls are worth 12M shares if covered which that alone is 30% of daily volume. The shorts make up close to 40% of the daily volume on a low day like this entire week. That‚Äôs 70% of fucking volume that needs to be covered if the stock closes at over $14 Friday. 

Not only will that be a huge loss to HFs, which we all love, but it‚Äôll be tendies because this thing is looking at a breakout to $20 if it passes the $14.72 level. By volume this stock is the most manipulated and a huge profit center for corrupt MMs and HFs. This can be turned as a tendie machine if squeezed.

This only works with billions in shares bought and held. This is the mother of all squeezes because of the size of the float and market cap. This isn‚Äôt something a few apes can do like $AMC or $CLOV. 

MMs are so scared that they put a 700k share sell wall 10 minutes before closing to not allow the share covering of the shorts to increase price and start a rally. This is a typical short attack to manipulate price to cover naked shorts. 

That‚Äôs my DD on what I am seeing on this and this is the mother of all Wall Street manipulation. You want transfer of wealth this is it. Not financial advice. All that needs to be done is buy and hold $GE shares.

Edit: DD on the company. It‚Äôs a great long position, $GE is simplifying and repurchased $7B in debt, they are growing their energy sector with renewables and are building the largest wind farm in the world off the coast of northern England and the coast of California. They are also expanding energy with the purchase of SPX. The aviation industry is picking up and $BA and $EADSY have locked in orders. On the day that $BA got an order for 34 737 Max the price tanked because MMs know volume is low. But orders are coming in and the share price value is around $16. Healthcare developed and is about to release a new handheld ultrasound which will be ground breaking. The company also got tagged to help Ireland with the 5G deployment today and is teamed up with the 5G deployment in the US.

Hi Everyone,

I love the Cleveland cliffs moves. My July calls are up 125%! Let's keep it up!

The next opportunity, albeit not your typical short squeeze, gamma squeeze, or any other squeeze of the sort. It is actually a pretty straightforward bet.

Allow me to Introduce **Uranium..**   ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è  ‚ò¢Ô∏è

Ah, sure, you guys can probably dismiss it but here me out. There are 3 big ETFs in the sector. URA, HURA, and URNM. URNM has been outperforming its rival by adding smaller and more speculative names. On stocks that get added to the index, we usually talk about small float and market caps that are sub 100m when added. There is an indiscriminate buy of the underlying equity for the next 3 weeks after the index rebalancing.

In March, I had done that research and got lucky on a couple of names added to the index. I circled in Red the period at which the index bough, and you can see the surge in volume. The great thing is that this ETF keeps growing in size because of the renewed interest in Uranium. That means that they need to keep buying shares at whatever price the asking price is every month to keep the relative position in % in the ETF. The below stock is Western Uranium and Vanadium. They also have strong fundamentals and are a perfect M&amp;A target for their next-door neighbor Energy Fuels. The current Ceo of Western owns 15% of the shares, and the share structure is super tight. They are currently only in the URNM ETF, and I think they have a good chance at getting into URA, the biggest ETF in the uranium sector. I obviously own a lot of shares, so take this with a grain of salt.

[Western Uranium &amp; Vanadium](https://preview.redd.it/owr8e1nfqa471.png?width=1568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13053cecc2e1c29fecb86022fe4b4db31a56a285)

&amp;#x200B;

You should ask yourself which other stock could be picked up by URA in the July rebalancing. That, in my opinion, is simple. You can check which stocks are owned by their rival URNM and HURA. There is only a handful of names that are not in the URA ETF. These names are:

Laramide resources

Azzarga Uranium

Mega Uranium

Vimy resources

Toro Energy

Forsys metals

If you are willing to wait a bit more, the URNM rebalancing happens in September. Currently, the best 2 performing stocks in Uranium this year are **Alligator Energy and Elevate Uranium**. They will most probably get included in the ETF as well. They could also make it in the URA rebalancing in July, but I see this as less likely. Another name that is on the cusp and could well make it into the ETF is Anfield Energy.

Another short-term catalyst is the transaction of Sprott acquiring the Uranium participation corp. For those of you who have been sleeping under a rock, Sprott has been able to grow its Gold and Silver ETF assets under management significantly. They intend to do the same with the Uranium participation corp, which buys and holds physical uranium. It used to be that when the fund's net asset value was +20%, they would issue more shares and buy more uranium. Sprott, however, will have an NYSE listing instead of a Canadian listing and will be an active buyer every month on the Spot market. The current spot for Uranium is at 32$, and we will need to seed 40$ to 45$ to see the party begin. Many in the space believe this will happen due to this move from Sprott on top of the foreseen shortage from all the supply destruction since Fukushima.

At this point, you should already have understood that you can front run institution and that this in itself is a great arbitrage-like situation. See the rise in URNM ETF. Quite interesting for a boring bet based on supply and demand.

&amp;#x200B;

[URNM ETF](https://preview.redd.it/gut63asnqa471.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=407bc70ae5d28c4d09b485f8a94ce7e979bcd2c8)

The current Market Cap of the total Uranium space is roughly 30billion in Market Cap. During the 2004-2009 bull market, the total market cap achieved for the total Uranium was 150 billion meaning an easy 5x from here in total. The granddaddy of performance was Paladin back then which started as a junior and became a big producer. The stock went from 0.03$ to 9.53$ in 4 years. Paladin is still a solid pick as they will be one of the first producers. Still, if you are looking at a story like Paladin today, I think a couple of names have the management and experience to bring an explorer to a producer within the next 4 to 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

[Paladin from 2004-2007](https://preview.redd.it/kms8r9arqa471.png?width=1561&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39c110601cef38b87e1b2d6791b11218afcc0575)

To reproduce this, you need to be in a jurisdiction that permits fast, or you have to have all the permits already. You need great management. You need a deposit. It helps if you also have short-term catalysts such as the ETFs or the potential to acquire a bigger player. Based on this, I think only a couple of names can be considered.

**Alligator energy**: In South Australia, strong management created billions in shareholder value in the last bull market. Deposit and strong jurisdiction.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lt2kbznvqa471.png?width=1561&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=908c04ad62d33c7a225cbfdb9284cca1171eb41c

**Elevate uranium** located in Namibia. Far from a producer, they have great resources; they are next to mills, which means they would not need to build one; they are in the best jurisdiction in the world. Management is not as strong as Alligator but higher share structure.

https://preview.redd.it/4q6gj38yqa471.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbd46de10341237dcdaf5687f4f9ce31e6c48187

**Western uranium** can come into production quite fast but need to strike a deal to mill the ore with Energy fuels. The shares outstanding are so small, making it susceptible to massive moves every time there is a buyer in the market with decent volume.

**Azzaraga** has a great deposit, can start production fast, and needs low CAPEX to get there. They have a good management team. Either Encore Energy or Ur-Energy can easily buy them.

**Laramide resource**: Management is top-notch. Great diversified assets. They can come into production or be sold. The CEO has been with the company forever and holds 10% of the shares.

If you need more resources to double down on, I suggest John Quakes on Twitter, Uranium insider is also another great name to follow.

I also suggest this great podcast discussion if you want to get up to speed as to why the uranium sector will more than 5x in the next 2-3 years.

As well as let you know that this auto maker is primed for a decent run in the mid-to-long-term. I've been playing them since their IPO. I hope these links are acceptable and can remove as needed.

One quick note I like to repeat to others is NIO has first place wins in the EV F-1 racing scene having the fastest times in the opening seasons. 

This means to me:
1)  They know how to build and manage power supplies.
2)They know how to build high performance EV drive trains
3) They know how to build high performance EV engines.

Now on to the discussion

Back in November 2019 NIO had reached a government backed deal to provide them with 2-5 billions in savings to manufacture at a factory in their Heife region. 

While NIO was managing the build of a new factory equipment they were able to ramp up production of their current model vehicle the ES6. Continuously hitting their production guidance released in their earnings calls. 

NIO then announced in January 2021 that they wanted to produce a more affordable sedan to compete with Tesla. In comes the ET7 this vehicle is slated to be produced at their new factory. To date I haven't seen any news that indicates they've hit a snag (5 day halt did occur) in building out the production capacity at the new facility. They released deal in May 2021 to produce 240,000 per year. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-extends-joint-manufacturing-agreement-090009258.html

This model vehicle will be their mainstream vehicle and it's planned to hit the road in the coming year. 

They've already expanded into the hottest market in EU for EVs Norway.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/nio-plans-to-start-delivering-cars-to-norway-in-september.html

https://www.nio.com/news/nio-announces-norway-strategy

Now that's all production and management of their vehicles. 

But what about the interior and software?!?!? 

Well they've done something a little out there but apparently the consumers are enjoying it they integrated an automotive assistant which is AI driven. This might be something that changes the relationship with owners and the vehicle causing them to hold the vehicle longer instead of reselling on secondary markets. Which drives the demand for new vehicles that they produce.

https://twitter.com/NIOGlobal/status/1394334686025961477?s=19

They also have NIO Navigate on Pilot 1.0 this is the same as Tesla Autopilot with the same suite of features. There's plenty of videos showing that this AI driven software is functioning as designed. This also indicates they aren't behind Tesla but right in step with them.

https://youtu.be/1UaGjztOi94

ONE NOTE about NIO Navigate on Pilot. They said they'd be working on an update but it has not hit the road. So this indicates to me that they're struggling with something to make it to the next phase. Once they release an update they'll be a leader in self driving vehicles in the largest EV market. 

Now just wait THERE'S MOAR! Geez... I'm running out of breath ü´Åüí®

They have a battery swap service that solves one issue that other EVs have. Super long lines and long charge times. They can swap your battery in their vehicle in 3minutes. 3min and you're back in the road that's as good as gas station times. 

They also released news on a solid state battery which has it's own combustion suppression properties that existing battery technologies suffer from. Google battery fires for four hours on Tesla. 

Some fundamentals:

They've reduced operating costs significantly last quarter.

They've increased margin on their existing vehicle
 https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-third-quarter-2020

They've increased sales month to month and year over year.

They've increased their revenue. 

So what say you? Is this a dieing company? NO

Is this company primed for success, yes! Will they keep up with the major autonomous vehicle players absolutely. Yes!


Two Last points 

1)They are listed on the Chinese companies in Congress for delisting THEY absolutely plan to stay in compliance to stay on the US exchange.

2) they are very active with news, and guidance so it's easy to stay up to date and allow you to reanalyze frequently what's good for your play."|wallstreetbets|$NIO has primed it's fundamentals. Steady growth on the horizon.|35.0|0.71

Dear retards,

Today  I was doing my DD‚Äôs and while doing my wacc, roe and other bullshit  analysis I had the smart idea to have a look at the Short Interest of  sndl.

While looking at it I was  astonished by the data reported by Bloomberg terminal. Our  short-interest ratio is 1.44, while amc is only 0.53 and gme 1.45  (source: Bloomberg terminal).

This means that the number of shorted shares is 1.44 times higher than the average trading volume which is absolutely crazy!!!!

The  percentage of the float is around 15%, however, the data of float  percentage has not been updated yet. IMO we could easily be at around  20, as gme and amc.

The main thing differentiating us from AMC and GME is the SI Score provided by Bloomberg terminal √† 2nd

amc is just 5th whereas gme 4th

To conclude the S3 rate temperature, indicating the seasoned financing levels with 1, 50 or 100

1= Liquid borrows typically indicating a short interest at or below historic terms

50= Marginally higher borrow levels typically indicating somewhat elevated short interest

100= Increased borrow levels typically indicating elevated short interest.

We  are currently at 50, ( gme stands at 1 (source Bloomberg terminal)) and  even in this case, the data have not yet been updated from the previous  month‚Ä¶.

The SQUEEZE is near we all need to hold sundial !!!!

Cheers and have a good day y‚Äôall degenerates

Synthetic Biology is a field in science focused on reprogramming micro organisms (yeast) to produce things like CBG or vanillin, rather than making alcohol. Its simple, feed cells sugar and they make whatever you want (because their DNA is rewritten). This field has been around for a while but has had recent breakthroughs that make it poised to become the next big thing.

In this example I will use cannabinoid fermentation as a base on how to evaluate these companies. I will be using Amyris in examples because they are one of the few companies that releases their stats.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Goal:** Try to create a strain of yeast that makes a lot of product (CBG) as efficiently as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

**Old Method:**

At its core, synthetic biology is reprogramming the DNA of yeast. You make some **edits** to DNA and you **select** the best performing strain, rinse and repeat *and pray* you get the best performing strain before you run out of money. That's the core of it, **editing** and **screening/selecting** strains.

&amp;#x200B;

**New Method:**

Its still the same reprogramming, the difference now is that the **editing** is quicker (thanks to CRISPR and genetic programming). The **screening/selection** is now boosted by machine learning. Machine learning uses a vast database to pick the promising strain candidates early on - this is one of the most important pieces. To give you a sense of how much quicker the process is - Amyris is doing 1500 DNA designs (**edits**) every cycle (two weeks) and their computers are **selecting** &lt;0.1% of 7.2 Million candidates screened per year.

\------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

**Critical Components to Understand Scaling:**

**Yield:** how much CBG the microbes can produce.

**Scale:** process of **editing** and **selecting** strains to have **high yield** in bigger fermentation tanks (100L, 10,000L, 200,000L). Bigger tanks = higher efficiency = $$$$$

Companies will get a **High Yield** strain and then try to **Scale** that strain. That's right, **its not as simple as just putting the little bastards in a bigger tank** \- you have to also fight **evolutionary pressure**. Making yeast produce CBG is sort of like if you engineered chickens to shit out pineapples. Think of how much work and energy it would take that chicken to make a single pineapple, it would be slow and clunky - this is the problem high yield yeast face in the tank. As yeast multiply there can evolve unproductive strains that expend less energy and can grow at a faster rate than the high yield yeast - unproductive yeast can take all the resources and ruin your batch.

**Evolutionary pressure is one of the biggest challenges to scaling and is more problematic the bigger scale you go.**

\------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

**Critical Components to Evaluating a Synbio Company:**

1. **Current Scale:** what size tanks are they currently producing at?
2. **Time to Scale:** how long have they been working on scaling? how fast do they get to bigger tanks? If its slow, they will be burning cash.
3. **Costs of Product:** How good is their yield per Liter?    *OR*   Cost of product per unit (how much they will charge for a kilogram of CBG). Companies do not like sharing this info, if they do, they are probably bragging.

Synbio companies are capable of creating virtually any molecule through this scaling process. It sounds like some kind of science fiction thing, but it is here now and very real.

Now that you know more of this field, here are some of the top players and their CBG stats.

||Current Scale (L)|Time to Current Scale|Costs of Product|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Amyris**|**220,000**|**1 year**|**\~$500/kg**|
|**Ginkgo**|**50,000**|**2.7 years**|Won't say|
|**Demetrix**|**15,000**|**1.5 years**|Won't say|
|**Creo (CBG/A)**|**12,500**|**\~5 years**|Won't say|
|**Willow**|**10,000**|**\~1 year**|Won't say|

&amp;#x200B;

**Its not about who is first, it is about who is fastest to scale.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Common Misunderstandings:**

""**Commercial scale**"" - **It's a big milestone but FAR from the finish line.** Commercial scale means that the product (CBG) can cover the costs of the supply (sugar). Much more scaling has to be done in order to improve margins and have a true product that can make money. Scaling does not end once it is in a biggest tank either, it keeps going in cycles. Amyris launches a campaign every 3-4 months - each campaign resulting in \~50% COGS reduction, approaching the cost of sugar. THAT is the type of sexy number you are looking for.

""**Purity**"" - yeast already produce things like insulin and other medical ingredients, purification isn't a big deal these days. If your scaling process is true, you should already be having excellent purity by fighting off evolutionary pressure.

\------------------------------------------

**More on Amyris for those obsessed like me...**

Some of you may be wondering why Amyris is so far ahead. It is simple, Amyris has been doing this since 2003. They practically invented the scale up process around 2011 and got it to a reliable state in 2016. That is why Amyris is years ahead of all of its competition, it literally had a head start.  It will take years for any other company to gather the required data for their **selection** process to be equivalent to Amy's.

&amp;#x200B;

**On Management...**

Management did whatever they could to keep the lights on. Anyone burned by that deserved it because we all should have done better DD - the financials were disgusting. The Amyris that rose from those ashes is a whole new beast though. I think these next ERs will prove that.

&amp;#x200B;

**On Lavvan Lawsuit**

I am not a lawyer, but I am not concerned with this lawsuit. I believe it to be frivolous. We see Amyris going ahead with CBG so their lawyers must believe they have a strong case.

RCL Agreement: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1365916/000136591620000179/a8kexhibit9902.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1365916/000136591620000179/a8kexhibit9902.htm)

When we went through the RCL agreement, we noticed something interesting... The ONLY time CBG was mentioned in the agreement is where it is excluded from ""additional cannabinoids"". So if it doesn't belong under ""Commercial Cannabinoids"" or ""Additional Cannabinoids"" it is not included in the agreement... its in a grey area and Amyris can do whatever it wants. That is my interpretation.

**Interesting thing to note:**

Ginkgo and Cronos pushed their production ahead of schedule. It looks like they are having some trouble scaling at the 50,000L tank level and something spooked them to capture the market quicker. Maybe some company producing CBG for $500/kg scared them? Amyris should be pushing it well below $500 in the future.

With that said, there's some things all of you all considering YOLOing into CLF/US Steel need to keep in mind.

**Trade Protections in Danger** \- [The US 25% tariff on EU steel is in jeopardy of being ended.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/trade-eu-us-start-talks-that-could-end-steel-tariffs-imposed-under-trump.html) If this happens, steel producers and raw iron miners are going to take a major hit. This wouldn't be a death blow to the domestic steel/iron mining industries, but would hurt nonetheless. This is my main reason for not YOLOing CLF at this point. Steel tariffs could very well remain in place, which I hope so for US steel workers.

**Limited Production Capability** \- [North America only accounts for 9.7% of global steel production while the EU accounts for 13.6%](https://www.worldsteel.org/media-centre/press-releases/2021/march-2021-crude-steel-production.html). This number is of March 2021, however the US never seems to produce the same level of steel as the EU as of recently. If the US was opened back up to EU, their steel production would almost definitely increase. 

**Domestic Manufacturers/Consoomers** \- [US manufacturers are in favor of ending tariffs.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/us-manufacturers-blame-tariffs-for-swelling-inflation/ar-AAKwZzr?li=BBnb7Kz) This is pretty obvious to assume, the steel scarcity in the US caused by the Trump steel tariffs obviously hurts manufacturing. A wide variety of manufacturers are petitioning the Biden administration to end the tariffs so we, as consoomers, can have even more of the cheapest and newest products. 

**Administration Historically Neo-lib Trade Policies** \- Members of the current administration and cabinet have had neo-liberal policies (free trade &gt; protectionist policies). I can't imagine the administration granting 0 concessions to the EU, especially since relations have become very strained between the US and EU the past 5 years. 

**Conclusion** \- Do your DD, stay wary of the geopolitical climate when dealing with commodities such as metals, oil, feedstock, etc. If you have already put in the money, God speed to you, I hope I am plastered on the front page in a month and have to delete my account in shame.

Due to sawmill shutdowns, and construction never stopping, Lumber has shot up. For the most part, before COVID, Lumber futures (1000ft of random length board) were regularly priced between $250-400. In May, Lumber reached a high of $1700. Lumber today is $1175. Lumber is still going down and there is still plenty of money to be had in lumber. Each point move is $110. Lumber halts at 63 upside/downside. Since May Lumber has had many, in a row, -63 point days. That equates to $6930. I have been able to capture many of these days.

The high cost of lumber is increasing the cost of a new home by $36,000 (BoA). America needs cheap lumber again. After a year of hardships, high prices are still taking a hit on hard-working Americans.

The meme stocks are great, keep buying them. But don't forget about essentials that are costing Americans way to much. Lumber still will go down. I share this with you guys to support the American cause.

This is going to be a LONG DD. But you can learn a lot about why machine learning is actually pretty difficult, and why Tesla is not worth as much as some people might think.

Let me start with my self and why I think I know stuff here that you might not:

I have a major in mathematics with a focus on statistics, game theory and probability theory. I work at one of the largest, top tech companies in the world. I have done multiple ML projects in my work, currently I am driving a project that is responsible for the newest edition of my company's Data Lake as a foundation of all our ML endeavors. I have contact and access to people from all the top IT companies (who we partner with e.g. for infrastructure, platform services and data science tools). 

I would be happy for anyone with else with deep knowledge to chime in here. People who know that Jupyter is not a planet and that you cant hide a Python in a wall made out of Databricks.

So with that out of the way, here are 4 reasons, why there wont be any (level 4) FSD cars in the next 5 years, not from Tesla, and not from anyone else. Let me start with the non - technical ones.

# 1.) Tesla does not fully believe in it themselves

As  stated in this [last 10Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021000046/tsla-20210331.htm#risk_factors) and referenced e.g. in this [news article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90630440/tesla-admits-it-may-never-achieve-full-self-driving-cars#:~:text=The%20disclosure%20comes%20after%20a,Tesla%20ran%20off%20the%20road.&amp;text=A%20recent%20filing%20with%20the,great%20white%20whale%20for%20years), Tesla is well aware of the risk that they may ""later"" or ""never"" achieve fully self driving (FSD) cars.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2.) But... Tesla's cars are already driving better than humans, as can be seen by their accident numbers per mile??

Well, this heavily depends on how you look at the numbers. [Pappa Elon's Tweets](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1383548841438236674) have shown pretty great numbers (10x more safe with auto pilot), a recent [forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/10/28/new-tesla-autopilot-statistics-show-its-almost-as-safe-driving-with-it-as-without/?sh=5b11f0ea1794) paints a picture that is more 50/50. So what is the truth? It is hard to tell. I have done plenty of KPI Reporting for board members of my company, I can tell you how KPIs like these typically are reported:

Firstly: Think about this: Where will the autopilot be activated mostly? Freeways, Highways... but not in cities, difficult traffic situations etc, right? Where do most accidents happen? Right. So Tesla's cars are accumulating miles and miles without accidents, driving in a straight line on a highway (something that btw almost ANY car from ANY brand can do - even 5-10 years ago). If you just report those numbers, of course you will get to a statistic like the one Elon posted. If you compare freeway numbers with freeway numbers, it is a wash (as it seems the forbes article has tried to do).

Secondly: In the foot note of the tesla report, they state that they count all accidents where the autopilot was active 5 seconds before the accident. Why 5 seconds though? Why not 10? why not 30? What would YOU do, if you were the one who has to create this report? Exactly.

Thirdly: Is # of accidents even the best thing to measure? Having less accidents obviously is important for the ADOPTION of FSD cars, but is it a good measure of how CLOSE we are to actually achieving FSD cars? Think about this: Most accidents happen (especially on freeways), when people are speeding, using their mobile phone or breaking the law in some other way. Of course the car never does this. So, shouldn't we compare the Tesla numbers to just the accidents where noone was speeding etc? Couldn't we achieve ""less # of accidents"" also by restricting cars with technology (e.g. mobiles are always deactivated near the driver seat, speeding is technically restricted)? Of course we could, but who wants that?

**Summary**: Measuring security of FSD Cars (# of accidents per mile) is a bullshit KPI to start with. It can help with adoption, but the reporting of it is very likely skewed or plain out wrong. I am not saying it is done in a fraudulent way, but I think it is not a fair comparison as it is done today. And any report can be tweaked a bit, to look better - just a tiny bit here and there. And this is done ALL THE TIME by all the big companies and players, because their bonuses and salaries depend on it.

# 3.) The data treasure of Tesla

So after some more high level and less technical arguments, lets dig into the matter itself. If you don't know much about how ML works, I would invite you to watch a movie that everyone can enjoy and understand. It is about AlphaGo, the engine that beat the game of GO. It is a great movie in itself, and it gives you quite some insight that you can leverage to understand this DD thread [AlphaGo Movie on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y). You might like it a bit more if you either played Starcraft in your life, or you are a nerd like me.

One reason, why many investors give Tesla an edge over their competitors, is the fact that Tesla has the most miles driven with full sensor cars, and they supposedly have that data available to build their ML models on. The whole thesis is based on the fact that Tesla can achieve FSD within 2-3 years, because all the other competitors are catching up here, and fast. The problem is, what do you actually do with this data? What data can Tesla realistically save?

Do they save ALL the data from all sensors including driver input, video, radar, ultra sound?

I have done a project once, where we saved just very basic sensor data of trucks from a customer. This thing produced 2 Gigabytes of data per hour driven (with sensors picking up one data point every second). There was no video or anything in there, just GPS data, velocity, stuff like that. So a Tesla would probably need much much more, right? It also cant be satisfied with a data point per second, it would need a proper data stream (video of at least 10 fps, same for radar) and have a multitude of sensors (according to google, something like 10 cameras, 12 ultrasound and one radar)

I don't even want to start guesstimating how much raw data a Tesla car produces, but I have seen numbers thrown around from 100 GB per hour to 3 TB per hour, which seems realistic given my own experience in the super simple use case I mentioned and the number of sensors in a Tesla car.

So what can Tesla do with this data? You certainly can not store all of the data from all the cars for longer periods of time. Anything above a few Terabytes (&gt;100) will be very cumbersome to use, will take ages to compute anything on, and will cost a shit ton of money to keep and maintain.

If you take just the 500.000 Tesla cars sold in 2020, and assume they only drive 1 hour per day on average and in that hour they only produce 10 GB (10% of estimated low), this would already be around 1 Exabyte of data per year (1700 Terabyte). Training any layer of a model (e.g. the layer that can find road markings) on such a data set is an insanely difficult and expensive task already. Nevermind the fact you probably need tens of thousands of them.

What I am saying is this: Even with their own data centers, and some great processing powers - it is impossible for Tesla to actually store and use all the data that they could collect. Today's storage and computing standards simply aren't big enough (yet).  I have some good insight into AWS and Azure and a few of the bigger university computing initiatives. Maybe Tesla has something that NONE of those have in their data centers. But I doubt it. It is general consensus, that AWS is by far the best here in terms of cost efficiency per computing power or storage size, since they basically practiced it for 10 years now AT SCALE.

They can collect a lot of data. But they can not keep it, and it is not the big competitive edge that some think it may be.  

And we haven't even started on data that is flawed (rain versus sunny weather), skewed (left driving countries versus right side driving countries) or simply bad quality (dirt on the camera). Anyone who has done ML projects knows that this is one of the biggest issues. I have done projects where we used satellite images on certain locations. 15 GB per picture of a 10x10 mile square location. Half of them had clouds, and you could not see shit (thankfully, modern services let you filter for pictures without clouds or only partly clouded). Then try to compute your 15 GB picture, even on modern infrastructure without taking ages, and THEN find out that the resolution is still way too fucking low for what you wanted to do. SIZE IS A PROBLEM.

# 4.) Complexity of Machine Learning

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone who has done any ML in their life, knows how difficult ML is, when it comes to real problems. Maybe you have now watched the AlphaGo Video. 

You might have noticed, that the example there is a very simple game with 361 squares, each of which can only be empty, black or white. This means, the input data structure is extremely simple. There are no flaws in the data, no artifacts and it was still a huge fucking deal when they ""won"".

You might have noticed, that the number of possible moves that the engine can do are even more simple than the board, as some fields will already be occupied.

You might have noticed, that there were **still** 50+ people working on building that engine, and it took them months/years. How many of Tesla's employees are working on this FSD, which is orders or magnitudes more complex?

You might have noticed, that even with all the simplicity, the engine still flunked at least once.

&amp;#x200B;

Now think of driving a car like a game with a multitude of players, non binary options (instead of steer left, steer right, it is more like a 120 degree field of steering from which you select exactly one, per (milli?)second). Data is skewed, flawed or in bad quality. Decisions can not be ""computed"" for minutes (even AlphaGo takes this long), they have to be made instantaneously. And they can't miss. It has to be 100% % correct. 

People who have done ML in the real world, will know that even relatively simple problems require quite complex models. These take hours to train and inference times are not always optimal, even on expensive state-of-the-art infrastructure.

Another, much more simple example for this is Google Translate. The smartest people, with almost infinite money took one of the biggest, if not THE biggest data set in the world (all written text ever produced) and tried to build a translation engine. Heck, this thing is great! But does it work perfectly? Of course not. Would you trust it with your life?

Someone smart once said, Machine Learning is good for problems where you need to be 51% right, like the stock market e.g.. A 1% edge is all you need. Driving a car, you can not afford to be wrong 49% of the time and ML is bad in those 99,99% problems.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusions:

The hype around Machine Learning is huge. And progress has been made. But the problems that autonomous driving needs to tackle are insanely complex. The technology is not there yet, and it is not going to be there in the foreseeable future. The human brain is still far smarter than any data center in existence. Probably even ML as it exists today needs a complete revolution in order to be able to solve some of the things that our brain can do, and driving cars seems to be one of those problems that needs to wait for that.

How to use this for investing?

I don't go short or buy puts anymore after **$SPY 180P 4/16** last year. But I think there is a big opportunity for other automakers. My favorite currently is $VW, and people have been catching up to it. They will be building the most EV cars very soon, and they can put in.

As usual here, none of this is investment advice.

# TL/DR:

Tesla wont get autonomous driving (L4) within the next years.

these are partners from 2018...this list has multiplied by 5x since then. Basically all car OEM HAVE TO partner with blackberry for software becuase QNX is the only Operating System (real time) that has the certification for safety and security ASIL D Certification. 

**Blackberry Partners from 2018. This list has multiplied 10x since then.**

**Summary: Blackberry based on peer comparison in cybersecurity and car and TAM of 84 billion and having full control of EV and car space should be $140 minimum.**

I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious that NKLA is undergoing a squeeze. As of May 14th, 34.78% of the float was shorted which amounted to 60 million shares. The stock is up 75% since May 6th as a result of losing less money than anticipated, good communication with their investors, and an overall change in sentiment as they emerge from their scandal. It is very easy to call NKLA **fake** and put it down based on the previous CEO‚Äôs behavior and mistakes the company made in the recent past. However if you believe in Hydrogen as the future of tractor trailer trucking and hate the sound of loud ass trucks then it doesn‚Äôt make much sense to bash a company for its past wrong doings especially in the context of them trying to make it right. Now if you‚Äôre shorting or lost money in the past on their F-up than your sentiment may never change. Here are some recent positives:

Sector: Healthcare

Industry: Health Information Services

Market Cap: [15.64B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GDRX/)

GoodRx Holdings, Inc., through its subsidiaries, provides information and tools that enable consumers to compare prices and save on their prescription drug purchases in the United States. The company operates a price comparison platform that provides consumers with curated, geographically relevant prescription pricing, and access to negotiated prices through GoodRx codes that are used to save money on prescriptions across the United States. It also offers other healthcare products and services, including telehealth services. The company serves pharmacy benefit managers that manage formularies and prescription transactions, including establishing pricing between consumers and pharmacies. 

**FINANCIALS**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/48av6v6nca471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc3799939bcab9c9a68007d12d70a6773c3dc70a)

**BULL ARGUMENT**

[According to simplywall.st](https://preview.redd.it/y6uajj9tca471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d87de20fac05271c1942a52e407068a91de83cc5)

The GoodRX platform has been effective because they positively impact stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. Benefits to participants in the healthcare ecosystem include: 

* achieving better outcomes by increasing medication adherence
* providing fast access to preventative care to reduce the strain on hospitals and emergency departments
* increasing accessibility to affordable prescriptions that otherwise may not have been filled
* enhancing consumer satisfaction and engagement 

GoodRX believes that consumers, healthcare providers, pharmacy benefit managers, pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers and telehealth providers all win with GoodRx. Their partnerships across the healthcare ecosystem, scale and strong consumer brand create a deep competitive moat that is reinforced by their proprietary technology platform, which processes and integrates pricing data points into an interface that is convenient and easy to use for consumers.

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

GoodRX has limited operating history and evolving business make it difficult to evaluate future prospects and the risks and challenges they may encounter. They rely significantly on their prescription offering and may not be successful in expanding their offerings within the markets, particularly the US prescriptions market. Moreover, they rely on a limited number of industry participants. GoodRX generally does not control the categories and types of prescriptions for which they can offer savings. Additionally, business is subject to changes in medication pricing and is significantly impacted by pricing structures negotiated by industry participants.

The telehealth market is immature and volatile and if it does not develop, or develops slower than expected, the growth of the business can be harmed.  For instance, Amazon launched a discount priced online pharmacy, last year, which [could negatively affect business for GoodRX](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/good-rx-ceo-dismisses-amazon-threat-customers-love-to-talk-to-a-person-in-a-white-coat-171844108.html). On June 8, 2021, Amazon announced it is [offering six-month prescriptions starting at $6](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/amazon-pharmacy-offers-half-yearly-prescriptions-starting-6-2021-06-08/) and prime members would get an additional savings when paying without insurance. 

**CONCLUSION**

Although simplywall.st has GoodRX as undervalued, I have a hard time seeing the potential for further growth especially with Amazon throwing its hat in the ring.  GoodRX may have potential for a swing trade over the next 2-6 weeks, but it‚Äôs not for me.  I'll sit this one out.

The ticker symbol is $NEGG and it is currently trading at a 3.91 billion dollar market cap. As many PC gamers know, Newegg has been a one stop shop for PC building for years. Additionally they have also been expanding into selling in other areas such as VR, gaming consoles, digital games, and Auto parts. 

They are currently trading at 1.5x sales and not too much information is publicly available about the stock which is why you probably haven‚Äôt heard of it. I have reason to believe that they will benefit from the increased demand of computer parts in the years to follow. The prices are competitive to Amazon and often times they have a wider selection of available things to buy from the site. I expect that they will also utilize the IPO proceeds to invest in improving their company/ spreading their reach as they are now a publicly traded company.

$CLF AKA Cleveland Cliffs is one of the **largest producers of steel in america.**

Have you tried building a house? Getting gym gear? Did you try to get a huge infrastructure plan going for the US which includes streets, bridges, buildings and what not all built with steel? anything to do with steel **GOT FUCKING EXPENSIVE.**

**Because Steel is in huge demand, because now that covid is falling back, people want to buy stuff, build stuff and all needs steel. Steel prices went to the moon! THEY FUCKING TRIPLED!**

In a matter of months prices for steel TRIPLED

WHY $CLF?Because $CLF is a big fucking steel producer, profitable, undervalued as fuck, forecast EBIDTA of $5.6B at a share price of 20$! RIGHT NOW $CLF should be worth at LEAST 35$, and that's not even counting in that HRC prices are over 1600$

üöÄ

SHORTS TRYING TO BEAT DOWN $CLF! üöÄLook at the chart:

**Price of steel increases over 50% in the same time, but CLF just trades 2$ higher than it did nearly 6 months ago? HOW is that possible?!**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0l8ltq4cea471.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cf66affb6be80aed7999df28615b113e934d1c0

2$ in nearly 6 months while the product increases over 50% in price in the same time?!

How do you explain, that a company that is this big, produces steel for whole america and where the **product price was raised by 50% and PEOPLE ARE STILL GRABBING IT LIKE ITS BLACK FRIDAY**.

Waiting times on steel orders for big companies are as **over 3 MONTHS** and more with the buyers paying any price the company wants. **That means with the same steel output the company now EARNS 50% MORE per ton of steel than it did in january!**

But the share price only rose 2$ since january, just about 10%? Do you see the problem?? CLF should AT LEAST be trading at 50% more than in january, but obviously, because a company has basic costs (running a furnace, personnel et cetera) - but at some point, with EVERY DOLLAR MORE THE PRODUCT COSTS, THE COMPANY WILL EARN DIRECTLY.

üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

Let's say producing a ton of steel costs 500$ in total. If the price of a ton goes to 750, to company makes 250$ profit. If the price goes to 1000$, the company instantly **doubles** it profit, with the steel price just increasing by 50%. Now if the steel price goes to 1500!, the company could make 1000$ profit. **Price doubled from 750$ per tonne, but PROFIT QUADRUPLED!**

Obviously there's a bit more to that, but that's the gist.

WHY CLF - A CHAD CEO üöÄ üöÄ :CEO LOURENCO GONCALVES is a fucking stud. HE knows the analysts are wrong and he KNOWS that people are shorting his company. And he WANTS TO FUCKING FUCK EM.

google CLF earnings call transcript

Read what he tells to journalists and analysts:

""**And then you say, well, Lourenco, the clients are complaining that they are not receiving steel. Yes**\[...\]. So they are basically collecting what they pointed for and we are taking good care of some of them, **some others we are not taking care** because I don't believe that they don't, they really even belong.""

**THEY JUST FUCKING DONT CARE about people complaining the prices are too high.**

""**Because we don't need all of this ""opportunistic"" players in the marketplace. They just destroy, complicate, gossip, talk on the phone, send fake information, do everything that we only done in the marketplace.** \[...\]. **So that's what we were working for. We are doing our mandate. We are doing our job. We are working on behalf of the shareholders of the company.**

I won't bore you with a ton of numbers that shows that **CLF is profitable** as FUCK, **undervalued** AS FUCK, have a ton of **CASH** and **shorts fucking with them** all the time. Look at the chart and tell me there is no reason with INSANE steel prices the **stock trades at JANUARY levels.**

However, it is important to mention that the financial situation of the company is no longer critical in the short-term. This fact is important because the former, seemingly, un-viable financial situation, was one of the bigger reasons the stock was initially shorted in so high numbers.

So what are these positive 'macro' indicators?

* Lockdowns are ending
* Citizens are hungering to reengage in recreational activities outside their homes
* 2021/2022 are going to be great movie years, due to many big titles being delayed
* Rumors/possibilities of strategic partnership(s) with producers - it makes sense, because there will always be a demand to experience high-end movies on high-end equipment.
* A renewed short-squeeze is still possible, although that is not my reason for being bullish - it's merely worth mentioning.

As you can see after performing our technical analysis, based on our macro indicators, here is our projected point: to the moon.  All aboard apes!

A combination of **high short interest, low float, increasing call volume** and **volatility expansion** (leading to IV expansion) will force Market Makers to delta and gamma hedge and shorts to capitulate themselves into a death spiral.

**All signals are GO. It's a fucknado powder keg about to explode.**

What will happen next? If you look at the 1min chart, $CLF is primed to break the $21.50 price resistance 6-year-high, and afterwards **there will be no reason for anyone holding any $CLF for the past 6 years to sell**. **This is the same story as $WISH:**

The IV expansion of all existing strikes will cause MMs to overhedge, **making the options market weigh more on the underlying market**, and as strikes become in the money the price action becomes a self-perpetuating feedback loop. In fact, Market Makers tend to LEAVE after meme-ification of a stock, **decreasing the float even more, destabilizing price resistance** while demand skyrockets.

The ultimate reason why this is a great fundamental play? **It's not even a shitty MEME company**. It has great fundamentals and is one of the greatest beneficiaries of our inflationary environment-- **the steel shortage is a powerful macro trend** that's increasing the cash flows and fundamental value of the company, and the leadership is one that will use this macro trend to reinvest, balance their balance sheets, and prime themselves to increase their dominance in the iron/steel industries.

Wish is one of the most under appreciated assets in all of commerce. The investment community is not a consumer of Wish given the demographic differences. Wish is a place where anyone from any financial background &gt;(50-55K average income) can buy affordable items. 

1. Discovery. When on wish you can scroll and find random items you never thought you‚Äôd buy
2. A discovery platform is hard to designs and gives Wish a massive data advantage over its piers 
3. Wish is a marketplace w over 100M active users 
4. 70% of sales don‚Äôt involve a search query 
5. 90% of purchases originate from mobile app
6. 45% US &amp; 85% of European consumers have a household income &gt;75K
7. Merchants gain instant access to 100M+ consumers 
8. Wish Local (local brick and mortar stores are pickup locations for wish products and the consumer saves $) 
9. Wish local gaining transaction 
10. Decentralized and asset light approach 
11. Most revenue per employees $2,904,000 average compared to $1,219,900 Etsy, $297,430 Amazon , Walmart $243,000, Macys $239,000 
12. Wish product boost helps promote the product 
13. Data, and unique user base is why wish is a great acquisition target 
14. Technology company that facilitates commerce 
15. üåü Jackie Reses from Square who came to Wish is going to possibly provide financial services to the underbanked and the merchants they serve. üåü 

Compared with other major marketplaces ‚Äî Amazon, Etsy, Alibaba‚Äôs AliExpress, eBay ‚Äî Wish is hardly a household name. This COULD change in the coming years.

I started actively trading shortly after the March crash in 2020. Leveraged a home equity line of credit and most of my life savings to make it big and take over the world, etc. etc. What followed was a year of anguish, elation, despair, joy, and indescribable horror. Maybe I‚Äôll write a book on it, or maybe a series of articles, because there was so much that happened nearly every day. 
I started with 65k and have been up as much as 11k and down as much as 30k. Today, I stand down around 8-9k. February through March of this year was particularly brutal, which saw me lose up to around 24k between my two day-trading brokerage accounts. It started when I jumped in at AMC at market close the day Robinhood and other brokerages decided to halt buying certain volatile stocks. I was down over 7k in a matter of hours. Chump change for some, but my biggest drop in a short amount of time, ever. At one point I was on my hands and knees silently screaming (wife was in the other room sleeping) nearly in tears over my misfortune. Fuck you Vlad. This was the start of my tumble downwards and I stand before you today hoping, praying, pleading, BEGGING that the stars align and my 1000 shares of SDC @ $10.50 a share takes off on an epic journey to the moon.

Like for example, SPCE is a retarded YOLO play, but there's an idea about its future.

Thus, I petition a temp ban of the word ""Squeeze"" in discussion, except for exceptional cases, where short interest is at 80%+ (This number can be negotiated).

&amp;#x200B;

* Lordstown CEO Steve Burns has called these arrangements ‚Äúvery serious orders‚Äù. The actual customer agreements, which we present for the first time today, require no deposit and are non-binding. Many of the supposed customers do not operate fleets nor do many have the means to actually make the stated purchases.
* Lordstown recently announced a 14,000-truck deal from E Squared Energy, supposedly representing $735 million in sales. E Squared is based out of a small residential apartment in Texas that doesn‚Äôt operate a vehicle fleet.
* Another 1,000-truck, $52.5 million order comes from a 2-person startup that operates out of a Regus virtual office with a mailing address at a UPS Store. We spoke with the owner who acknowledged it won‚Äôt actually order any vehicles, instead describing the ‚Äúpre-order‚Äù as a mere marketing relationship.

Caught in a lie...the CEO later had to go on CNBC and claim that they were not in fact orders but ""letters of intent to buy"" there was no paperwork signed, no money exchanged hands....

Sweet.

So basically:

TLDR:

\-CEO is a liar, he artificially inflates numbers

\-CEO got a delinquency letter from the SEC...bc he didn't know how to lie his way out of his filing

My next play is NVAX and I have a firm belief that NVAX management may drop their phase 3 data at premarket tomorrow. They have two investor relations meetings etc next week and usually a biotech wants to release the data beforehand. Furthermore, when you look at NVAX marketcap, it's trading at a significant discount to the rest of the vaccine companies, but the vaccine doesnt need fridges and it had fantastic data in phase 2. NVAX ran to 330 on the last round in 5 trading days, so I expect a similar pump if their data is good. 

Yesterday had the largest darkpool buying of NVAX in months. Today there was 3 orders at the ask on the tape totaling 45000 shares. You may think that's small but the NVAX tape is relatively thin and these are the largest orders that have been registered on the open market for the past week in terms of orders at the ask. My guess is that news is imminent. 

Anyway, this is my DD. My price target based on MRNA marketcap is around 500 for NVAX if we value NVAX at 30 or so billion (MRNA marketcap is 84 billion). The valuation takes into effect that NVAX booster shots may be a solid contender next year for all other mutations and the fact that NVAX vaccines are more amenable to large scale (no fridge, traditional vaccine), making it ideal for third world countries etc."|wallstreetbets|NVAX may drop phase 3 data in the next 24 hours|58.0|0.86

Remember what happened the last time a stock had borrow rates this high? Everyone seems to be bashing CLOV as a distraction from other stocks but to me it looks like after the price spike yesterday the shorts have doubled down on their position.

Since CLOV reached its ATH from the activity yesterday new short positions had to be opened in order for hedge funds to prevent further losses. The shorts are already under a lot of pressure as the share price is higher than any of their previous short positions unlike all of the ""tHE neXt BiG sQwEEz"" plays you retards have been posting for the last 24 hours.

Holy shit, it now costs 116% to short CLOV. For those that don‚Äôt know, CLOV is a healthcare company with limited shares available to trade because insiders can‚Äôt sell until the stock trades at $30 for a 90 day period. What‚Äôs interesting is that short sellers shorted the stock &gt;40% and now they have to fight with retail for the remaining stock to cover their shorts. But here‚Äôs the problem, they haven‚Äôt covered their shorts yet, the stock is up 100% and as you can see from the borrow fee, some are probably close to a margin call. They are scared shitless because this thing can go parabolic. I‚Äôm talking $50-100 a share! 

So what are shorts doing today? They predictably tried to crash the stock in the morning by shorting (selling borrowed shares) and that coincided with day traders taking profit. A pretty predictable tactic that is designed to scare retail into selling. Don‚Äôt let them fool you. This stock still has plenty of gas left, with an option chain up to $43 now!

LETS FUCKING GOOOOO

Edit: Fuck off with the ü§°ü§°ü§° posts, it won‚Äôt save your favourite ticket and/or it won‚Äôt help you with your short position.

After market update: 

Well today was wild. What we saw was a combination of short sellers fighting back, probably some profit taking and perhaps a gamma ramp down. But the facts of the stock still remain the same. The stock is:

- Shorted by more than 40%
- More than 15% of the float is locked up with insiders WHO cannot sell
- Shorts are now even more underwater with crazy high borrow rates on their new shorted shares 

When people talk about the VW squeeze. There‚Äôs always a period before the spike where the stock dips. That dip was today. Now it remains on longs to keep pushing and we‚Äôre going to really benefit from a bigger option chain and another gamma ramp upwards.

Governments' and environmental bodies' focus on reducing carbon emissions, increased customer awareness, and falling EV costs are some of the key factors contributing to the increasing popularity of electric vehicles.

The decreasing cost and increasing efficiency of batteries used to power EVs could accelerate that transformation. This is where QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) could play a crucial role. Let's see why the company's work in advancing the battery technology is promising, and where it may stand five years down the line.

A solid future
One of the major factors restricting faster growth of EVs is the limitations of current batteries. The lithium-ion batteries currently in use face certain constraints. The two major disadvantages to combustion vehicles is the range on a single charge and the time to recharge. That's a big drawback compared to gasoline-powered vehicles, which can be refueled in minutes. Moreover, the battery costs are still high for mass adoption, even after falling significantly over the last few years.

A young woman charges her electric car while her dog watches patiently.
IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

QuantumScape claims to have developed a proprietary material that can be used to make solid-state batteries that will allow the current carbon or silicon anodes to be replaced with lithium-metal anodes. Its solid-state batteries are more energy-dense, and so can provide a much longer range without the need to recharge. They also can be recharged faster compared to the current batteries, and, in theory, can be produced at a lower cost.

While this sounds promising, it's important to note that a lot of research work remains to be done before the technology can be commercialized. QuantumScape's batteries have only been tested in labs so far. The company hasn't also yet produced the multi-layer stacks needed in automobiles. There are several other technical factors that the company needs to work on as well before its product is ready for use.

When will QuantumScape start production?
Despite uncertainties, if things go according to QuantumScape's plans, the company could start pilot production of its batteries in 2024. Five years from now, the company expects to have a production capacity of 6 GWh (gigawatt hours), which would be enough to support around 60,000 vehicles. It still might not achieve positive EBITDA by then, however -- it expects that could take one more year from there.

In its latest quarterly letter, QuantumScape shared encouraging results relating to its four-layer cells. The company is still working on increasing the layers to meet the requirements of automobiles. It also reiterated its expectations of starting commercial production in the 2024-2025 timeframe.

The battery stock is promising,and it has many famous investors such as Bill Gates and volkswagen
At the same time, it has a formidable task at hand. Solid-state battery technology has been researched for years, but no company has been able to successfully commercialize it so far exept for  QuantumScape

Talk about the stock has been rampant on all chat boards, the options in/out the money as far the eye can see are on fire and the volume is about to surpass its all-time high.

WHY TODAY and why haven't you heard about it on CNBC, when they discuss unusual volumes, option volatility, MEME stocks, and on, and on...???  
Well, SDC is suing CNBC for making false claims in a report last year and asks for reparation of no less than $2.85Billion.  
It would look very poorly for CNBC to have to report that SDC shares and SDC products and services are in high demand and that the markets are unanimous that its shares deserve a better valuation and multiple. In other words...

Their deliberate silence on the subject of the company's fundamentals, reputation, and all matters SDC related seems to prove positive that they can't back their previous negative statements about the company, its products, business model, competitive strategy and position, profit potential, growth opportunity, supervision by dental professionals AND consistently improving customer satisfaction and service quality metrics.

In conclusion, CNBC's position is not in great standing as far as negotiating a settlement with SDC.  
Besides the sensational rise from the recent bottom, the volume of retail investors flocking to the stock, and its unique 35% short interest (short squeeze), SDC qualifies for MEME status because of its chances of prevailing in the lawsuit/negotiations with CNBC have significantly increased."|wallstreetbets|Deception from CNBC|18.0|0.79

\- according to Nick Smith ""Recent regulatory, structural and market changes have set the backdrop for what will likely be the most dynamic period for investing in the new origination non-agency residential space in decades. As a result of these changes coupled with mortgage credit availability at levels last seen almost a decade ago, we are confident that we will be able to prudently grow our Non-Agency loan portfolio by delivering our origination partners attractive product offerings.""

\- $1.2 billion of MTM recourse financing and $422.9 million of non-MTM non-recourse financing as of March 31, 2021, as compared to $580.1million and $466.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020

\-  continued progress shifting the portfolio into residential loans, which now represent over 60% of the portfolio (with the end of pandemic in sight with prospective new buyers moving back into the city and the housing market is the way that it currently is, i like this)

\-  Fundamentals remain favorable for the housing market and the consumer

\-  They work best in environments where rates are rising and spreads can widen (and with fears of inflation being discussed, interest rates would ultimately see a rise)

Long story short, about halfway through the treatment my upper left canine tooth fell out. To make matters worse, this missing tooth was in stark contrast to my upper right canine which is abnormally long and vampire-esque.

My wife endlessly made fun of me. She called me homeless Dracula. K-Mart Dracula. Etc. But the jokes soon turned into animosity. She told me she couldn‚Äôt keep going out in a public with me while I looked like a gay vampire who lost a tooth in a boner blood sucking accident.

I‚Äôm a doorman for a living. My wife called me a hillbilly butler everyday as I left for work. A dental implant would have cost me $3,200. I couldn‚Äôt comfortably spend that much at the time. $3,200 is a lot of money for me. Besides, I eventually began to embrace the missing tooth. My first name is Gordon, and so my colleagues started calling me Gordie Howe. 

As time went on I accepted the fact my wife probably left me for reasons other than just the missing tooth. That was just a dental scapegoat. But the odd looks and comments from residents entering the building I work at have become too much on a daily basis. I am a doorman, not a hockey player, after all. I don‚Äôt need my wife back. Me and her boyfriend never got along anyway. But I NEED my tooth back. 

I used all the spare money I have in the world and bought 30 6/25/21 $13.50C. If there‚Äôs one thing I know about SmileDirectClub, it works, possibly too well. It moved my teeth so rapidly that I woke up one morning with one resting on my tongue. It‚Äôs the real deal.

**When?**

Starting tomorrow and lasting as short as 2 weeks or as long as a few months, with a hot CPI number as the catalyst. For those of you who don‚Äôt know and are literally trading stocks without paying attention to anything going on in the economy, the CPI (Consumer Price Index) number is the main gauge of inflation.

**How big?**

10% or more, depending on the magnitude of the CPI beat.

**Why?**

A feedback loop driven by algorithms that trade based on bond market data.

**Why should I give a shit about the bond market?**

I don‚Äôt trade bonds, and think bonds are for fucking nerds and boomers, but if you‚Äôve been in the market since the beginning of the year you know that the bonds, specifically 10 year treasuries, are arguably the most important market drivers in the world. The bond market is about twice as big as the stock market and the price action of bonds dictates the movement of the stock market to a large degree. A big swing in the bond market has the potential to completely fuck the dynamics of the stock market and the CPI. When bonds get bought, the 10 year yield goes down and when they get sold, the yield goes up. The 10 year yield also goes up in response to inflation and dictates the mortgage rate one can get at a given time, the interest rate at which businesses can borrow money, etc. It is therefore a very important indicator for earnings predictions and general economics. Algorithms (which account for about 80% of stock market volume( either directly look at the 10 year yield to make trades or derive earnings estimates and other money flow from the 10 year yield.

**What have 10 year treasuries been doing lately?**

At the beginning of the year there was a correction based on a rising 10 year yield that was particularly bad for growth and tech stocks that do well in a low interest rate environment. The 10 year yield has been very low over the past year because when the market crashed, the fed enacted historically dovish monetary policy to bolster stocks and the overall economy. One of the policies the fed enacted was purchasing of bonds by the US treasury in order to keep the 10 year yield stable.  In recent months there has been talk of a ‚Äútaper tantrum‚Äù  wherein the fed begins to phase out those stabilizing purchases as the economy recovers. Powell has been adamant that he will keep treasury purchase in place for the time being and that he will give us plenty of warning before he begins to taper bond purchases.

Last week, the fed announced that it was going to stop buying corporate bonds and ETFs, which was another dovish policy similar to treasury purchases that they were doing in the corporate bond market. The fed wasn‚Äôt doing a huge amount of corporate bond buying so that wasn‚Äôt a huge deal for the economy or market, but caused some to get nervous that the fed may be getting ready to ease 10 year note purchases in the months ahead. However, this fear was short-lived because last week, employment data came in that showed lower-than-expected job growth.

Generally, job growth is a very important inflation indicator. So important that until a few months ago when the fed changed its mandate, it was the main factor determining whether the fed would raise or lower interest rates. A cool employment number caused the bond market (also largely algorithm-driven) to buy a lot of 10 year bonds because weaker job growth is supposed to mean weaker-than-expected inflation. Therefore, over the past week, the 10 year yield has made a big move (about 8%) down and caused the broader indexes to rally. The S&amp;P, Dow Jones, Russell 2000, and Nasdaq are all at or near record highs based largely on the fact that bond yields have been going down and algorithms have been triggered to buy. Right now the 10 year is hovering around 1.5%, which is the lowest rate it has been since March. Since the initial rise at the beginning of the year, the 10 year has typically bounced off of the 1.5% level and has gotten as high as 1.77%. Despite the rise of the 10 year, it is still well below its pre-crash levels of 2% or more.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is going to happen to the 10 year yield going forward and how is that going to trigger an algorithm-fueled, gay bear feedback loop?**

Above I talked about how the 10 year yield fell on the cool jobs number. The glitch in the market matrix started last week when the ADP private payroll number came out. The report said 978,000 new jobs were created in May, a high number that was relatively in-line with most estimates. However, the ADP report has, for some reason, not been accurate over the past year or so. When the real employment number published by the government came out the following day, showing a mere 559,000 jobs being created, a corrective rally in 10 year treasury notes started and has persisted into today, driving the 10 year yield to multi-month lows.

*To summarize what has happened so far: ADP gave an employment number that diverged from the government employment number, the government employment number missed estimates, bond traders and algorithms derived a low inflation number from those low employment numbers and overcompensated bond purchases, bond yield went down, stonks went up.*

This overcompensation could affect the bond and stock market tomorrow and in the weeks ahead. There are a few potential catalysts that could drive a big move in the 10 year and the downstream stock market over the next week. The first one is a 10 year note auction today at 1 pm. While I don‚Äôt expect the auction to cause a major change in treasuries, there is a possibility that some selling could occur this afternoon to cause fluctuation in the 10 year since the price is at a multi-month high. Tomorrow and next week are huge catalysts though, because the CPI number is being released. While bond traders and algorithms attempt to derive a rough inflation number from employment data, the CPI number is the ‚Äúreal number‚Äù that indicates the level of inflation the economy is experiencing and what price people are paying in the typical transaction. On Wednesday next week, the Fed meeting and Powell‚Äôs subsequent comments will dictate how the Fed will respond to the inflation number and whether it will raise interest rates (it won‚Äôt) or begin tapering bond purchases (it might).

*The bear thesis is contingent on tomorrow‚Äôs CPI number being a huge beat.* That was the case last month and a big reason for the May selloff. While the expected number was 0.4% MoM, the actual number was double that (0.9%). Given that 10 year bonds are very overbought with an 8% rally this week, a hot CPI number like the one we saw in May could raise the 10 year yield as much as 10 basis points. If it goes up 5 or more basis points, a correction is highly likely and will have a magnitude proportional to the strength of the 10 year yield move. This is not guaranteed. This month‚Äôs CPI number is projected to be 0.3%, but based on various factors like continued housing market strength, increased oil prices (especially over the past month and with a big miss on crude inventories data this morning), and general price increases (see Chipotle news), I tend to think 0.3% is a very low estimate. Moreover, employment data may have been a red herring for bond traders and algos because of the continued unemployment assistance being given by the government. While a weak jobs number would normally produce a similarly weak CPI number, unemployment assistance has the ability to elevate prices without job growth. That is the main issue with the data being used by algos right now. While the bond market won‚Äôt necessarily react violently to a hot CPI number, the recent rally has it primed for a selloff and resultant spike in yields.

**Other Red Flags**

A few other things happening in the global economy and in volatility are making me nervous.

*A big one is China.* Yesterday, China released its own CPI along with its PPI (producer price index, or cost to manufacture goods). The Chinese economy showed a divergence between CPI and PPI, which is irregular. While Chinese producers showed the biggest overhead cost increase in decades, they seem to have decided to eat the cost and elected not to pass the price increase on to consumers. This makes sense if you agree with Powell‚Äôs standpoint on inflation being ‚Äútransitory‚Äù (temporary). Eating production cost increases isn‚Äôt a big deal if it‚Äôs only for a few months and while it might cause company profits to dip, it won‚Äôt have a far-reaching economic impact unless it is sustained and producers are forced to pass the price increase to consumers. While I agree that huge inflation reads like I expect tomorrow are transitory, I still think overall inflation has picked up in a relatively permanent way. The current labor shortage along with job creation via stimulus and potential infrastructure spending will force companies to offer new employees higher salaries and increase salaries permanently across the board.  Also, something tells me US companies are less likely to eat increased production costs than Chinese companies which rely on low costs to gain an advantage over foreign rivals. There is also the possibility of the government instructing its companies to hold off on price increases while the recovery is taking place.

*Also, volatility is at an inflection point*. I follow volatility pretty closely, understand it, and have [written about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmt5s0/fyi_for_people_new_to_the_vix_and_vix_etfs_before/) in the past if you want to understand it better.  Currently, the VIX (which measures options premiums of S&amp;P 500 stocks) is near post-crash lows. It got as low as 16.57 yesterday, which is about 7% off the low (not a lot for the VIX), and has generally bounced off of that range during swings over the past year. Today it‚Äôs up to 17.21. For comparison, it got up to near 22.00 during the May correction and was in the high 30s during January when meme‚Äôs almost destroyed the stock market. While a VIX rally doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean there will be a correction, high option premiums imply that institutions are hedging big swings. VVIX, the derivative of the VIX which measures the rate at which options premiums are changing and generally goes up prior to big moves, is way up today (9%). VXN, the new volatility measurement of the Nasdaq, is also near post-crash lows. While volatility is still elevated compared to 2019, the next couple of weeks will determine whether volatility decreases to pre-crash levels (10.00-20.00) or continues to stay in the range it has been in (20.00 to 40.00). Continued volatility decrease would be a good sign for the market, but I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôre ready yet given the uncertainty of the situation.

**Powell**

If there is a correction, the length of time it will last is based largely on the Powell testimony. A hot CPI number might cause bond markets to freak out, but the fed‚Äôs stance will largely dictate whether a spike in the 10 year is confirmed and continues into the 2% range or if it stays steady. The CPI number will play a little bit into the speed at which the fed tapers asset purchases but they already know what they‚Äôre going to say next week for the most part. Another part of my bearishness has to do with my opinion that Powell will announce tapering between now and the end of the year next week, which could cause a correction regardless of tomorrow‚Äôs inflation data.

&amp;#x200B;

**Oh yeah, RSI**

Edit: I forgot to add in the part about the indexes being overbought. They aren't horribly overbought like at levels we saw in September, but they're at levels they've bounced off of a few times in the past. This means there is plenty to sell if there is a bearish catalyst. In recent months, SPY has been able to do okay maintaining rallies in overbought conditions, while QQQ has performed pretty poorly when RSI gets above 70. RSI spikes (in either direction) on the yearly chart have been decent forward indicators of corrections since 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**How to play**

Don‚Äôt buy VXX, UVXY, or any other leveraged index fund or volatility tracker. Those suck, have low upside, and don‚Äôt necessarily go up and down the market (see link above for explanation of VIX futures funds). Just play puts in the indexes (or calls if you disagree with me). I tend to think that monthly QQQ and IWM options are good targets because they have more beta than SPY. But the Nasdaq has already had a big correction while SPY has been largely unaffected and is closer to (may close today at) record highs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Bond market could shit its pants and cause a correction if the market underestimated the inflation data coming out tomorrow. Happy Pride Month.

Edit: Thank you for the pee martini, kind stranger!

Edit (6/10): CPI was higher than expected but not as bad as I thought it would be. Market correction may be delayed until Powell testimony but could still start today or tomorrow. If futures go down &gt;1% that's a bad sign for indexes. Look for a 7+ basis point daily gain on the 10 year yield. Look for a fast dip in RSI. All of these are indicators that it's imminent. 

Powell will likely have to announce the taper next week and it will likely be gradually until the end of the year. Markets will probably bounce next month when the CPI report reveals that inflation is normalizing. However, oil prices have been spiking in June so if they continue to rise then CPI might not give a normalish print until August. If indexes see a &gt;10% correction, give up YTD gains, and panic ensues, it will be the best buying opportunity of the year.

This theory attempts to explain the movement of all the meme stocks rising together, regardless if they have real squeeze potential or not. Notables include $BB, $RKT, $BBBY, $NOK, $CLNE, $WKHS, $WISH, $CLF, etc...

**Theory**

The world watched the some of above mentioned stocks pump through the roof in January for presumably no reason according to fundamentalists, the only explanation given was that something called Gamestop was squeezing because of something called naked shorts and a cat was involved. Now here we are 6 months later and the media is saying the same stuff, like ""reddit is at it again"" and ""meme stocks are up 300%"". So if you were a boomer hearing that on CNBC wouldn't you put 1 and 1 together and realize you can profit from this? You would probably look up what reddit previously pumped and FOMO hard into whichever meme stock hasn't quadrupled yet? Why not, seems to be a foolproof plan. Squeeze all the things right?

We're seeing an insane bull run here on everything reddit touches, the profit potential doesn't get better than this. I fomod hard into $CLOV on Wednesday before closing bell and by Thursday morning had closed for a cool 14x on my calls.

**TL;DR**

Boomers are seeing a repeat of January and are FOMOing into every stock reddit has even jizzed on since then hoping to get in on the action. That's why $BBBY, $RKT and other random shit is seeing nice returns since the media coverage picked up. As the news cycles are slow to pick up on the action, these stocks likely have another 1 - 2 weeks before they fully peak. More if GME moons after the 6/9 meeting today! üöÄ The reddit momentum that would bring would change everything.

I've been patient with AMC in the last of couple days with over $100k invested @$19. I'm starting see a familiar pattern with CLOV. I see a similar pattern with AMC's second day of rise and CLOV's behavior today. With an initial spike, both of these stocks all started with a high pre-market price and a cooldown throughout the day. Eventually, AMC showed this pattern for a day or two until it shot up for the last time before the short squeeze began. CLOV is still at an infant phase of a massive potential squeeze. The shorts are putting on pressure to keep CLOV low, but the counter pressure from retail investors are holding the stock and not give into the panic. Holding the line for a day or two will accumulate more retail investors, who are buying these dips. If CLOV is the next short squeeze play, it will surpass AMC in a heartbeat.

Prediction:

CLOV is a gamble play for sure. There is always a probability of short squeeze happening depending on many factors, like media and sentiment. However, CLOV was my next pick because the numbers showed me that it definitely had a massive squeeze potential, and I saw a familiar resemblance with AMC. High risk high reward.

If CLOV plays out like how AMC did, CLOV will close today with the resistance around $17\~$18 range. The next morning, CLOV will see a massive spike during the pre-market and cooling off for a bit throughout the day. Then CLOV would've stabilized around $20 and the shorts will start to get impatient. They will have to cover their shorts because they are not seeing CLOV going down anywhere close to $7\~8 again in the next couple of days. Thus, the short squeeze will begin. Once it begins, more retail investors will join in. With the options expiring on the 18th, more people will join in seeing a potential gamma squeeze. I can see this stock go to an unimaginable numbers if the pattern continues. 

This is a domino effect play. The first step has to be completed before moving onto the next. I believe that the first step is already completed, and we are at the second step, fighting against bearish sentiment. Third step is the squeeze. Fourth step is wait for the squeeze to stabilize, and the last step is to cash out the profit.

This is purely my personal opinions and not a financial advice. Seeing how big the wallstreetbets community is, a pattern like this is likely to happen again. At the end of the day, retail investors don't change their behaviors over night because we are not under any management or any strategy. The pattern will repeat."|wallstreetbets|$CLOV showing a similar pattern as $AMC and $CLOV prediction for this week|505.0|0.72

I started studying an option play for earnings releases and did a bunch of experiments on a paper account that i wanted to share with you. The idea is to check if what I had in mind about IV crush and possible profit would be correct. I tried different strikes and expirations, all bought a day or two before earnings (not ideal i know).  I find stocks with an important expected move (more than +/- 5%) and tested different strategies.

I chose $LOVE and $UNFI for this week. Here are the results:

&amp;#x200B;

|symbol|type|expiration|strike $|break even $|price|today roi|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$UNFI|straddle|june|40|32 - 47|680$|\+12%|
||straddle|july|40|30 - 49|871$|\+3%|
||strangle|june|25 - 50|24.8- 50.2|76$|\-75%|
||strangle|july|25 - 55|23.8 - 56.2|111$|\-65%|
||strangle|jun|35 - 45|32.2 - 47.8|286$|\+10%|
||||||||
|$LOVE|straddle|june|85|75.1 - 94.9|1300$|\-40%|
||straddle|december|85|48.9 - 121|3600$|\-6%|
||strangle|june|80 - 95|75.4 - 99.6|711$|\-50%|
||strangle|december|75 - 100|47.1 - 127.8|2530$|\- 6%|

&amp;#x200B;

We see that going with long expiration makes the break even interval larger but the options price falls less than close expirations (iv crush after earnings i suppose).  We can get smaller break even interval obviously with smaller delta but the options price rises sensitively.

Basically the lesson here that confirmed what i had in mind: options around earnings are very risky in the sense that if you're not right about the movement (not in your break even), they tend to lose most of their value and you lost (which is fair enough since you are gambling on that move). You can get longer expirations that would decay slower in case you miss, but the premiums get higher and theta would still eat at it. In a nutshell, better be sure of what you're doing!

On top of that, with the news of the next TestFllight being scheduled for July, this can reach $50 without a problem. Take advantage of any dip opportunity.

$60 is a strong resistance for it, but with all the news going on with the stock, this can really be upward of $100 by end of year. All depending on testflights, but from technical level it has the chances of reaching this.

I told people on the Daily Discussion to buy Clover last Thursday for the gamma squeeze and you would be swimming in tendies if you listened (you would have turned 35k to 1M+ if you bought 6/18 10c). The shorts dumped GOEV at open today to prevent a gamma squeeze from happening just like they did with Clover on Thursday (clover went from 10.40 at open to 8.40) , but eventually they won't be able to stop it once it starts getting traction just like what happened to Clover , it only took a weekend for people to know about Clover.

Investor day is on June 17th and if any good news comes out then prepare to blast off to an exoplanet. The IV on the options is fairly low , so this is easily a 20x-40x bagger for the 6/18 calls and 2.5x+ for shares accounting just for the gamma squeeze and some shorts covering , but if positive news comes out of the event then we will see much bigger gains.

Apple tried to buy them out for the people who just started trading this year , it's just a fun fact.

Canoo is highly likely to be added to the Russell 2000 , they are in the preliminary list , all the new stocks that will be included in the Russell 2000 will come into effect after the market closes on June 25th and the announcement of the inclusion can happen on June 11th , 18th , 25th.

Even if you aren't playing for the short term , this is a good long term stock to hold , it's undervalued for an EV company that is unlike any other.

We've all seen how $WISH and $CLOV have performed this week based on their float to short float ratio. Wendy was a worthy pump and dump though, and we see how memes can be more than dreams. Seeing Cramer on TV try to make sense of it was quite the distraction. Well, here I come with DD on a similar ratio on $SENS (Senseonics Holdings, Inc.), a biotech/healthcare company much like CLOV.

Biotech/healthcare companies are always risky because they need approval by the FDA, clinical trials and investors need to have a complicated understanding of the science and technologies behind the companies. So easiest laziest thing to do? Short them.  The kind of stuff that halts the U.S. advance in science all the time and why shorting + naked shorting is so scummy for companies that are legit trying to help people.

Why buy into a good company and help it grow as well as your money, when you can make double or more the $$$ by shorting it to the ground until bankruptcy? Don't have to cover your shorts either AND maybe get some easy assets while at it??!!üí∏üìâ

Here you can see how SENS is trending upward since it's breakout last week and has been testing multiple supports for months now.

# SHORTS, FLOAT and outstanding shares

Here is the data for SENS according to [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SENS&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SENS&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)

&gt;**And how does it compare to $CLOV and $WISH?**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xxx1addou9471.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1528ef2fb6e9b97e3247e31cdda880d55821931a

As you can see, SENS has about 80m less float than WISH and 160m more than CLOV with a 25.8% SHORT on that float. We can see that we can have a price movement which could be between WISH's and CLOV movement this week.

$SENS also has quite a low market cap of only 1.5B take or give. It's also not under any major ETF, and the ones that own it only have about 3m shares total, so it cant be fucked from major ETFs movements.

Low insider ownership as well

**ü¶ßSHORT VOLUME ""It'S nOt iMpoRtAnt""ü¶ß :**

Short volume is important to see how shorts operate everyday. If for exemple your price is 20$ but shorts have entered at 25$, they're comfortable. But as we can see here, they are always shorting about 50% from the current price. That means they didnt have much positions open higher. So it should be easy to push right now.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q8ccdhxqu9471.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffa4d3baa6c736eb43df086e4582138c29a1bc47

As you can see here, whenever SENS makes a move up, everyday, it's almost always above 30% to 50% shorted on the volume of the day, so automatic market orders most likely, which means that as soon as buy pressure starts coming in we're gonna have some shorts that will enter, things is they won't know that this buy pressure comes from a mass amount of retarded apes, so the algorithms or whatever the fuck will kick in to short the volume as if it's everyday normal buy pressure... They'll get pushed back and squeezed to cover.

#                                       FUNDAMENTALS

Founded in 1996 and serves the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

SENS has recently traded up last week after a successful trial of a new CGM system (monitoring system for diabetes), that's why you see the price up from last week. Broke their penny stock class up to above 3 dollars.

So, not only are they successful in their technologies, they have been in the business long term and help people across the world. They are putting forward a chip that lodges underneath the skin and connect to your mobile device to monitor your glucose levels by Bluetooth. Instant access and always on you. So why are they shorted again? Oh yeaahh, easy target as all healthcare companies are as usual. Especially in these hard times since the pandemic..

# SO TL;DRüöÄüåõ

* Easy squeeze from high short interests and everyday volume
* Low float to grab and high short float
* Cheap af right now with upwards movement driven by success in the company
* Low insider ownership
* Founded in 1996 and serves the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
* Broken price resistances and tested them three times on the daily
* Is currently above that same resistance based on fundamentals, so with some help it can go to the next one and through easily to moon
* Trending above 200 EMA for close to 7 months now
* Both long term and short term plays
* Some mentions here and there, current interest in the price is backed by fundamental and mutual funds so perfect time to get in

**üöÄTHIS IS THE NEXT CLOV OR WISHüöÄ**

I WISH upon a better U.S. Healthcare system, maybe $WISH could help send some cheap-ass glucose monitoring system over to our recent patients due to engulfing too much WENDY's Tropical Berry Lemonade(berry...$BB.. mmhhm ? it comes full circle...). I don't know. $WISH upon a star to reach and make $SENS of $WEN the tendies are here!!

So far today, the share price has fallen a lot because short volumes have increased even more. This happens because shorts are protecting their own positions and hope that it will continue to create further selling pressure.

It's crucial to understand that yesterday's short volumes has contributed to send the stock downwards today as well. 

Wednesday's share price fall is a good entry on CLOV the decline is purely short term from new shorters coming in and trying to push the stock down so they can rebuy and cover their shorts

The OPEC+ summit next Tuesday is widely expected to send a confidence signal to the market as the decision to gradually increase production is reaffirmed as economies gradually open along with increased demand for oil. 

Kinder Morgan (KMI) is perfectly positioned to capture all the benefits of the upcoming surge in energy demand whether it be oil, natural gas, ethanol, etc. as it is one of the biggest players in North America in energy infrastructure. As a signal of confidence it has increased its dividends by 3% and increased guidance for the year 2021. During the Texas Storm crisis, KMI was one of the few energy companies whose infrastructure did not break down and was able to sell electricity (albeit at a premium) at a tremendous profit amounting to nearly $880M. 

Look out for the OPEC+ summit next week and grab your calls now because this baby will pop once energy demand is locked and loaded.

In it‚Äôs latest fundraising it secured a further $82m funding from: Google Ventures, AWS, Samsung, Airbus, Lockheed Martin and Bosch. The funding is being used to develop ‚Äòtrapped ion computing technology‚Äô which is able to operate at room temperature and has the longest lifetime of any qubit. 

IonQ‚Äôs founders wanted to build the most powerful quantum computer using trapped ytterbium atoms. This method, whilst not the most common has unique advantages including low error correction, high gate fidelity, scalability, noise reduction, less space required and lower costs to operate, as it requires no refrigeration and minimal electrical costs. 

The founders Jungsang Kim and Christopher Monroe both bring formidable technical credentials. Jungsang Kim leads the multifunctional integrated systems tech group at Duke University, where his lab leads the world in miniaturisation of quantum systems. Christopher Monroe has been working on quantum computing for 25 years and demonstrated the first ever quantum logic gate. Between them they have secured over $160m in grants. 

Despite quantum computing being in its infancy they expect to earn $5m of revenues in 2021, with the long term business model being Quantum computing as a service (QcAAS) possible due to increased scalability being an advantage of the trapped ion method. 

To summarise quantum computing is one of the next big technological advancements, they have attracted the best business and technical minds of any quantum computing business to date.  If you factor in the increased scalability and how much backing/pipe investment (Silver Lake, Fidelity, Hyundai, Time Ventures, Breakthrough Energy) they‚Äôve secured it looks like they are financially secure, have first mover advantage and are in pole position to capitalise on the future shift to quantum computing."|wallstreetbets|IonQ/dMY technology III|3.0|0.64

They have substantial cash reserves of $400,000,000 roughly 1/3 of their market cap so there is no immediate requirement for cash.

32 days of consolidation at lows meaning an extremely strong base has been put in at this price. Everybody has been shorting during this period is now trapped.

Its acquisition, which closed Monday, is expected to expand XL Fleet‚Äôs electric vehicle charging infrastructure capabilities, the company said

XL recently inked a deal with UBS arena to provide charging stations, solar generation and energy storage. For a total of 1,000 charging stations which is one of the largest deployments in the United States.

The company they inked the deal with also owns another 30 properties. Meaning more contracts is a very likely outcome.

They also announced that to cover their current clients who consist of names like Fedex, Coca Cola, Pepsi etc they would need to install over 100,000 charging stations making them the biggest player in the industry.

100's of millions sitting in cash

Finally a Short Float of 23.3% approx 22,000,000 shares short. For a comparison this is more than $AMC and $BB.

The market cap and share float are so small that the room for an explosive move is enormous.

I'm personally looking for a minimum of Shitrons target at $60 a share and based on current future projections

**DISH is the next short squeeze.** 

* 30m shares being shorted.
* 2.8m average daily shares traded (last 15 days). 

This means it will take 10 days for the hedge funds to cover their short. It could easily 3x the daily volume from buying pressure alone. This could be hell of a squeeze my friends! 

Beware shorts, you shall feel the pain!    


https://reddit.com/link/nvz3m5/video/17to2ppcf9471/player

Take Clover as an example: If we exclude Yesterday‚Äôs crazy 735m shares traded, CLOV was trading 25m shares per day and had 30m shares short. It would take less than 2 days for CLOV shorts to cover. That compares to 10 days for DISH. 

The options at CLOV started to pick up 4 days ago. For example, the 6/18 $22 calls had 6k open contracts at 6/4 (June 4th) and on 6/8 (June 8th) started the day with 19k open contracts, but the volume on the 6/8 was an astounding 260k and open interest is Today 57k, it nearly trippled from the day before. So currently, these 57k contracts equates to 5.7m shares that needs to be purchased. For CLOV that is 23% of the avg daily volume, but for DISH that would be 2x the daily volume. And that is just one contract as an example. 

* Screenshot of CLOV calls Yesterday: [https://paste.pics/CR7CT](https://paste.pics/CR7CT)  
* Screenshot of CLOV calls Yesterday: [https://paste.pics/CRIU7](https://paste.pics/CRIU7)

&amp;#x200B;

My point is that DISH is technically better positioned to squeeze the shorts. It trades much lower # of shares per day and has same number of shares being short than clover (30m shares). 

In addition to that, I think DISH has an amazing thesis, just like GME in some ways. 

**Quick Summary of DISH thesis:** 

1. DISH is the only company with enough spectrum to cover the entire US with a 4th 5G network. For those who are unfamiliar, Spectrum is an irreplaceable ‚Äúreal estate‚Äù in the wireless industry. 
2. The other 3 players are Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. The Enterprise Value of these 3 players combined is more than $1 trillion dollars. 
3. DISH on the other has an enterprise value of only $35 billion. That‚Äôs ridiculously low, given that DISH has already spent $20 billion over the years to acquire their Spectrum capacity. This same capacity would be worth almost $50 billion if we price it at the same price of the last auction that Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile paid ([https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-at-t-t-mobile-dominate-81-billion-5g-spectrum-auction/](https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-at-t-t-mobile-dominate-81-billion-5g-spectrum-auction/)) 
4. What‚Äôs even better is that DISH is building their 5G network with next-gen hardware technology called O-RAN, which is ‚Äúcloud-native‚Äù. It means it‚Äôs faster, easier and 50% cheaper to maintain compared to legacy hardware infra that AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile have. (Rakuten in japan has built a 5G network using O-RAN, proving this new technology). 
5. In the future, with autonomous cars, smart cities, IoT, drone deliveries, big tech companies will need more and more network infrastructure and they are likely to prefer to use DISH. 
6. An early sign of this, is the Amazon deal to use DISH network for AWS and other needs. Amazon will soon start doing drone deliveries, they also have Amazon Prime, they might re-launch the Fire smartphone. The fact that Amazon chose DISH proves their value. 
7. **Fundamentally speaking, what is the upside?** The market will be huge, as this is a very scarce resource and DISH for the very least will be the 4th 5G network in the US. So what is the value of the 4th 5G network in the largest economy in the world? I don‚Äôt know the exact answer, but I know it is NOT $35 billion. So if we think in a +$1T market, DISH can have 10-20% market share? They should be worth at a minimum $100bn and probably close to $200bn. That means the stock would be worth anywhere between $140 and $298 per share.

In an interview with CNBC, Simon said he was pleased that Tilray had become a talking point on the WallStreetBets subreddit and other forums. 

""We like to have them as part of our shareholder base,"" he said, referring to activist retail investors. These investors, says Simon, make excellent shareholders because of their deep knowledge of the company and its products. 

Tilray also announced the launch of a new medical cannabis brand called Symbios yesterday. At launch, Simon told CNBC that the product would provide a lower cost medical alternative for patients with pain and arthritis. 

The Tilray boss also referred to a new SweetWater beer available on Delta Air Lines flights and said that one day he could envision CBD and THC drinks on air travel to calm passengers' nerves. 

Most recently, the mail order company Amazon, which supports a US bill to legalize cannabis across the country, boosted the shares of cannabis companies. 

""And because we know the issue is bigger than Amazon, our Public Policy Team will actively support the Marijuana Opportunity and Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act) - a federal act that legalizes marijuana at the federal level, deleting entries inside criminal records and invest in affected communities, ""wrote Dave Clark, head of Amazon's Worldwide Consumer division, in a blog post published in early June.

there  very likely will be some changes to how capital gains (when you  generate income by selling something for more than you paid) are taxed,  at least for the very wealthy. but dividends seem to be protected, even  if there have been murmurs the other way. taxes on dividends could be  less than half the rate of those gains -- but how can everyday investors  like us benefit? should one start thinking more about companies that  pay regular, growing dividends?

increasingly,  it feels like the answer is yes. and if tax changes do come to capital  gains, the wealthy will shift their focus more from growth to value, but  particularly high quality names that pay dividends. take it one step  further, those companies with dividends 1.5x-2.0x the rate of the 10yr  treasury (2.25%-3.00%) or greater are probably the best positioned.

A combination of **high short interest, low float, increasing call volume** and **volatility expansion** (leading to IV expansion) will force Market Makers to delta and gamma hedge and shorts to capitulate themselves into a death spiral.

**All signals are GO. It's a fucknado powder keg about to explode.**

What will happen next? If you look at the 1min chart, $CLF is primed to break the $21.50 price resistance 6-year-high, and afterwards **there will be no reason for anyone holding any $CLF for the past 6 years to sell**. **This is the same story as $WISH:**

The IV expansion of all existing strikes will cause MMs to overhedge, **making the options market weigh more on the underlying market**, and as strikes become in the money the price action becomes a self-perpetuating feedback loop. In fact, Market Makers tend to LEAVE after meme-ification of a stock, **decreasing the float even more, destabilizing price resistance** while demand skyrockets.

The ultimate reason why this is a great fundamental play? **It's not even a shitty MEME company**. It has great fundamentals and is one of the greatest beneficiaries of our inflationary environment-- **the steel shortage is a powerful macro trend** that's increasing the cash flows and fundamental value of the company, and the leadership is one that will use this macro trend to reinvest, balance their balance sheets, and prime themselves to increase their dominance in the iron/steel industries.

This sub has heart, and the potential to do a lot of great things for a lot of great companies that are struggling right now. I have a stock proposal for you all. I know we've all got our sights set on a handful of different stocks. GME, AMC, BB, CLOV, CLNE. These are all great companies worth saving. I have holdings in most of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get into this stock, I think there is one thing we can all agree on, that the healthcare industry in America is a steaming pile of hot donkey doo doo. Providers charge way too much for their services because Obamacare basically gave them a free pass to charge whatever the heck they want. Insurance companies charge employers and employees insane amounts for garbage insurance packages. Currently the healthcare system in America is in a broken loop at the expense of every day working class citizens and at the expense of companies that are being charged egregious amounts in premium. Politics aside for now, what if I told you there was a way to help the situation with how messed up healthcare and health insurance is right now. Its a brand new AMAZING thing never before seen in finance, its called reference based pricing, apes. Its where insurance companies pay for provider services based on a fair, reasonable, historical values as opposed to grabbing a price out of thin air and charging you $4500 for an X-Ray of little Timmy's sprained ankle. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's another issue with health insurance that you may not be aware of, and that's contracting. Currently Insurance companies and providers have sort of a . . . don't ask, don't tell, policy when it comes to auditing insurance claims. Providers and big name insurance companies have agreed with one another not to disclose itemized details on services provided so that they can charge employers insane amounts for services. Which is why you see providers charging 50 smackeronies for a Toy Story Band-Aid.

&amp;#x200B;

This is also hard on employers too. Lets say you work at a tire factory, and you get lung cancer. You get treatment, the provider stuffs the bill with garbage, charges your insurance company millions of dollars. Your Insurance company agrees to pay, your employer none the wiser. Now, your company is hemorrhaging cash in premiums to the insurance company because the insurance carrier they chose isn't doing their job. Which means, the rest of your facility isn't getting raises this year. Meanwhile your healthcare provider and the insurance company is laughing at the bank. 

&amp;#x200B;

What if I told you there is a struggling company that slaps a Band-Aid on all that for a fair price. They audit the claims, forcing providers they're contracted with to charge reasonable amounts for their services. Which results in lower cost for both employees and employers. Increasing quality of life for every day Americans. I'm talking about MPLN. The stock price is sitting between $8-9 with a short interest of around 7.2%, sure nothing spectacular. But imagine being able to stick it BOTH to big healthcare and big hedgies all in one swoop. All we need is a little push from retail to give this bad boy some momentum and we're one step closer to making the world a better place while making some tendies along the way. This is not financial advice, I just like this stock.

BLNK is universally hated by wallstreet and hedge funds. It has a 30% short interest and a thinly traded float. Once/if the momentum starts, it should blow up.

PROS:

* Short interest is 30% of outstanding float (ORTEX). Third most shorted, behind CLOV and WHKS - both of which have popped!
* Daily volume during flat days like today is 1 million (3 million is average). So when it moves, it moves.
* IV is no yet wrecked. The call premiums are still ridiculous though, even for FD's

  
CONS:

* Stock price is $40 so a bit above the average ape price.
* Does, in no way, deserve its current 1.8 billion MC. However, to be fairish, the company has been trying to cash in on its MEME potential by picking up competitors. So maybe, someday, it will work out. Its a clown market right now.
* Maybe bagholders that are happy to show up and dump on any upward momentum. But that didn't stop CLOV or WHKS so who knows

The a positive condition of the underlying indicators should keep the current uptrend intact.  The stock should continue to be a market leader.  The stock has outperformed the market over the last 50 trading days when compared to the S&amp;P500.  

MACD-LT, an intermediate term trend indicator, is bullish at this time.

$AMC chart formation indicates a strong rising trend.  Upside momentum, as measured by the 9 day RSI indicator is positive.  

Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on up days than on down days, indicating AMC is under accumulation, which is a bullish condition. 

The stock is trading above a rising 50-day moving average.  This validates the strong technical condition for $AMC.

The stock is above his 200-day moving average, which is pointed up indicating that the intermediate term trend is bullish.

While I'm still not 100% certain on the longevity of the company yet until I see more progress, short term I think this thing has plenty of room to run in the current market.

This isn't something that $WKHS paid cash for, its basically free stake in that company.

The stock fell from $80 to $40 because Amazon bought Wholefoods, which happened to be their largest source of revenue and the fear was that Wholefoods' new overlord Amazon would not renew the contract.

In 2018 United Natural Foods paid 3B for Supervalu which more than doubled their revenue from 10B to 21B transforming them into the largest grocery wholesaler in North America in an attempt to diversify its revenue and reduce its reliance on Wholefoods. Yet the stock kept tanking going sub $10 now the stock is $32 but still way below the all-time high of $80+.

Today their market cap is only 2.25B (8% of sales) and about half of what it used to be when revenues were only 8B. Once Price/Sales ratio reverts back to 50% of sales this will be over a five bagger (not even taking into account future revenue growth).

WELL Health is lining up to be the next CLOV. 

WELL Health Technologies (WELL) (WLYYF) 

*  20%+ Short Interest
* Raised $305M priced 30% above market led by the 29th richest man in the world. 
*  JP Morgan and RBC extended credit lines to over $500M combined
* Aggressive M&amp;A activity that caused no dilution which now puts them as the largest clinic provider in Canada and expands footprint into the US through CRH Medical. 
* Nearly $500M in revenue with $100M in EBITDA 
* Fenwick &amp; West Engaged for a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year - Fenwick did literally every big name from FB and AMZN to COIN and is extremely exclusive. Likely that they selected WELL. 

By no means am I saying CLOV is a bad company I really like them both but WELL just seems like a situation where the market hasn't caught up to the fundamentals and I think it's just a matter of time now.

TRQ is a Canadian mining company that runs what is projected to be the world's third biggest gold/copper mine by 2025. The project is located in Mongolia, the company and the government don't seem to agree on anything and a gridlock for contract expansion has been going on for a few years now. The problem is due to a split in the structure of the government of Mongolia.  The MPP, the party that controls the cabinet and the parliament (about 80%of the seats) is favourable to foreign investments and wants to work with $TRQ, the president, who has a veto power is a populist who wants nothing to do with foreigners in Mongolia, even though he didn't say how he will manage the mine without the required technical knowledge. Anyways, long story short, that's what's going on, and $TRQ stock price has suffered from the uncertainty despite very solid fundamentals. 
The story of the day: today is the presidential election in Mongolia.  The MPP is favourite to win, and the sitting president is barred from running.  
If the MPP confirms the victory, there is no stopping $TRQ from hitting $100 before the end of the year with such strong economic outlook.

BARK completed its merger with a SPAC last week.

It is now supercharged and a growth stock that has moonshot potential written all over it.

**And, it is HUGELY shorted: 106% S.I.**

The BARK Company, best known as BarkBox, provides dog-focused products and services to pet owners. Though you'll find its products in 23,000 retail doors, it's predominantly an e-commerce company that relies on high-margin subscriptions. 

As of the end of March, it had 1.2 million subscribers, up 91% from the prior-year period. BARJ's S-1 filing notes that monthly product retention is higher than it's ever been, which signifies that a high percentage of subscribers aren't cancelling.

If this isn't convincing enough, consider that it's been more than a quarter of a century since year-over-year pet expenditures declined in the United States. This year alone, the American Pet Products Association expects nearly $110 billion will be spent on companion animals, $44.1 billion of which is on food and treats, which is BarkBox's specialty.

Innovation is also important for BARK. Last year, it introduced Bark Home, which allows dog owners to purchase basic-need accessories like collars and beds, and Bark Eats, a program that personalizes and delivers a high-quality dry food diet to dog owners.

A stop loss will put in a sell order at the pre-defined price you establish. This let's you sit back and relax knowing no matter what, you are going to exit at a good healthy price for you.

2. You can adjust those stop losses. If you are up 25% and it shoots up to being +100%, you can adjust that stop loss to a higher limit.

tl;dr: I'm $300k deep in Sports Entertainment Acquisition Corp Warrants. This company is taking SuperGroup, the parent company of Betway, public. $10 stock and $2 warrants now, $20 stock and $10 warrants soon. Details below.

&amp;#x200B;

SuperGroup is a gambling company based out of Europe. The company has two branches: Betway and Spin. There's a good chance that you've heard of Betway. The company sponsors West Ham (Premier League) and advertises on several NBA courts. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d2rpzqjpn8471.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb64038d490a2c64e304499d0229a45bb1577062

Betway had solid revenue growth even with COVID cancellations last year, and the company is projecting $550M in revenue this year.

Meanwhile, Spin is an online casino. Spin has online card games like Blackjack and Texas Hold 'Em along with ""slot"" games and arcade games.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/01s9wnl3o8471.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b8c2a470034a934b05365b49b90c806b50a54bc

Spin did $1.4B in revenue last year, and it expects $1.6B this year. Spin's revenue growth wasn't affected by COVID-19 because it's an online casino. None of its operations were impacted by quarantine rules.

How does SuperGroup differ from other sports betting stocks? Well DKNG is the US market leader in online betting in the US. DraftKings is expecting $1.1B in revenue this year, but the company will post a heavy net loss due to its high cash burn rate. DraftKings is losing money every year as it tries to aggressively scale its growth.

PENN, another US favorite, has several billion in lease obligations due to its physical casinos.

SuperGroup is fully online and already profitable. No Capex costs are a major plus. Here's the formula for SuperGroup's success:

Spin is a profitable online casino. Betway is unprofitable but growing quickly. Free Cash Flow from Spin fuels growth for Betway, which then expands SuperGroup's brand and brings more customers to both business branches. Spin is the cash cow that fuels the overall machine, and Betway is the source of future revenue growth. Unlike DraftKings, SuperGroup won't have to issue new equity to have the cash needed for its growth.

Okay, so what? Another betting play. Well let's look at the valuations:

https://preview.redd.it/3md8o0h5p8471.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02b76fe9371578d272ef3ff0101707a2ce27939d

SuperGroup is dirt cheap compared to the field. DKNG and GENI are quite expensive, but if the stock trades in the low range of the group (4.4x sales), then it has 50% upside from here. Warrants would increase by at least 100%. If it trades closer to the midpoint (7x sales), the stock has 120% upside and warrants could pop off for 600%.

SuperGroup is active in Europe, South Africa, and South America, but the company has aggressive US expansion plans. SuperGroup is acquiring Digital Gaming Co, a US licensed betting company. SG plans to rebrand DGC as Betway and open operations in the domestic market. The company's revenue projections only include current markets, and every dollar made in the US will stack on top of the projections listed above. SG is trading at 2.9x sales if it never places one bet in the US. The company doesn't need to win the US market; it just needs to take a small piece of the overall pie.

But there's already so many US plays, why will SuperGroup be successful? Because of Sports Entertainment Acquisition Co's management team.

Eric Grubman: ""Previously, from May 2004 until July 2018, Mr.¬†Grubman served in various roles with the National Football League (NFL), most recently as the Executive Vice President of Business Operations""

John Collins: ""Mr.¬†Collins served as Chief Operating Officer of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 2008 until 2015, after previously serving as Senior Executive Vice President of Business and Media from 2006 until 2008. Prior to his roles with the NHL, Mr.¬†Collins was President and Chief Executive Officer of the Cleveland Browns NFL team from 2004 until 2006. Earlier in his career, Mr.¬†Collins served in numerous roles at the NFL, including as Senior Vice President of Marketing, Sales and Programming.""

Natara Holloway: ""Ms. Holloway has served in various positions at the NFL since 2004, initially serving as a Manager in the Internal Audit department, and currently serving as the Vice President of Business Operations and Strategy for Football Operations, a position that she has held since April 2019. In this role, she oversees football technology and innovation, administration and football pipeline development. Previously, Ms. Holloway served as the NFL's Vice President of Brand, Marketing and Retail Development and as Vice President of Corporate Development - New Business""

Timothy Goodell: ""Mr. Goodell has worked at Hess Corporation, a global energy company, since January 2009, where he now serves as the Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer. Mr. Goodell also serves as General Counsel and Secretary at Hess Midstream GP LLC, the general partner of Hess Midstream LP, both subsidiaries of Hess Corporation.""

**I don't care about Goodell's business experience though. Do you recognize the last name? He is NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's brother. Interesting, right?**

SuperGroup signed a partnership deal with the NHL right before the Stanley Cup playoffs, and the number of NFL connections makes me believe that we'll see a similar agreement with the NFL soon.

So now what?

Buy Sports Entertainment Acquisition Co. Buy warrants if you want some real upside. Make bank when this stock finally gets some coverage.

$WISH:

Big price ramps from $10; $12.5; and $15 - doesn't look like it's  only retail buying  after-hours and pre-market. How many of the people here actually have permission to buy during pre-market or post-market hours?

How high can $WISH go?

Pre-market is at $15 with a volume gap and no resistance until $20. From $20 upwards, the path is rockier BUT... We did see a lot of call volume at $20 and even more at $25. So if price reaches and is able to break that higher resistance up to $25, then it's fly high land

It was a bit ill timed but people who stuck with the trade and added to their position when the nasdaq was at 13K have been wholly rewarded. With the nasdaq close to 13900, what is next ? 

 I think the nasdaq can still go to 14250+ given the bonds move and how real rates are pushing down. and it's not just me telling you that inflation is transitory, people actually believe in it now and it is becoming the consensus narrative. 

The institutional market is extremely long steepners and that's why they are getting rekt in bonds. 

So far it has not really hurt $XLF as it was saved by strong positive gamma, but yesterday the $XLF switched to negative gamma for the first time which now makes it vulnerable to serious drawdowns.

**What i want you to do is to offset your long $QQQ or $QQQ Calls with a short $XLF or $XLF Puts in similar sizes.**

Inflation prints are missing all over the world (where it matters) like china's miss this night.

A few excerpts from sellside houses recognizing that inflation is transitory now

CITI This week  :  CITI: ""Central banks usually get more dovish when YoY inflation peaks. Given the normal lags, investors should then start to rotate out of inflation trades over the summer"" 

 . JPM: ""This unhealthy spiral between rising commodity prices and the inflation forwards could start waning""

I‚Äôve been following this name for the last few weeks as we broke down 78% from the ATH put in December 2020. Dropping from $34 to $6 , This was no doubt due SPACs getting hammered across the board and the short seller report from Muddy waters posting a lot of misleading information.

In December Citron actually went bullish on the stock issuing a $60 pt.

Both the technicals and fundamentals are now extremely lined for a squeeze with heavy shorts being trapped.

**Basic Stats:**

Market Cap: $1b

Public Float 94.4m

Shares Short: 22.11M

Share Float Short: 23.3%

32 days of consolidation at lows meaning an extremely strong base has been put in at this price. Everybody has been shorting during this period is now trapped.

Vanguard loaded up 6,000,000 extra shares with some other funds increasing their positions.

Possible entry into the Russel Index which would see far more cash flow into the name.

On the 26th March 2021 a total of 205,641 shares were awarded to employees at an estimated cost price of $6.81; With a one year lock up. Giving them a massive incentive to hit targets.

XL recently bought WEES in a 50/50 cash and stock deal which again in my opinion is a great buy. World Energy generated $18 million in total revenue and was free cash flow positive for full year 2020. Its acquisition, which closed Monday, is expected to expand XL Fleet‚Äôs electric vehicle charging infrastructure capabilities, the company said

XL recently inked a deal with UBS arena to provide charging stations, solar generation and energy storage. For a total of 1,000 charging stations which is one of the largest deployments in the United States. 

The company they inked the deal with also owns another 30 properties. Meaning more contracts is a very likely outcome.

They also announced that to cover their current clients who consist of names like Fedex, Coca Cola, Pepsi etc they would need to install over 100,000 charging stations making them the biggest player in the industry.

100's of millions sitting in cash

Finally a Short Float of 23.3% approx 22,000,000 shares short. For a comparison this is more than $AMC and $BB.

The market cap and share float are so small that the room for an explosive move is enormous. 

I'm personally looking for a minimum of Shitrons target at $60 a share and based on current future projections 

This is of course not financial advice and I'm long, will be buying more dips.

Let me start by saying I stole all this information from various sources. Tried to take the most important stuff. The gaming sector as a whole is at all time highs. CRSR is arguably the industry leader in the type of hardware they produce. I AM NOT SAYING THIS IS A SHORT SQUEEZE‚Ä¶‚Ä¶maybe a lil one. Unlike my wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs dick. The % of the float held by institutions is 81.04%. The short interest is 19.94%. Someone check my math but pretty sure that equals 100.98. Not enough wrinkles in my brain but seems like this should count for something, however small. On to the DD. 

‚Ä¢	Current share price $31.80. 

‚Ä¢	TTM P/E = 20.59x. 

‚Ä¢	% Held by Institutions = \~77.24% but with insider shareholders hold 81.04% of the float.

Turtle Beach is trading at 11.29x and near ATH. Logitech trades at 24.03x and is at ATH. Now this is difficult for CRSR because they just IPO‚Äôd less than a year ago. P/E ratio will likely step more in line with next earnings.

1623239962.0|0.0|t3_nvu1ln|28.0| [**ViacomCBS stock**](https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/VIAC) (NASDAQ: VIAC) has lost almost half of its value in just the last three months as the stock dropped from $80 to $42 currently. The market had been over enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. The management decided to take advantage of the boom in the stock price by offering additional shares to raise close to $3 billion. This issue was priced at $85 per share, which was a 15% discount to where the stock had been trading on 22nd March ($100 per share). In addition to the fact that the new issue would dilute the existing shareholders‚Äô value, commentary from Wall Street research firms that the company‚Äôs management itself does not think that the recent rally of the stock to $100 is justified, led to a sharp reversal in fortune. This led to the stock declining ever since, and the drop over the last three months comes to about 48%. Additionally, the equity swap fiasco at Archegos Capital Management led to the hedge fund selling 30 million shares of VIAC stock in an apparent move to liquidate the fund, thus exacerbating the fall inVIAC‚Äôs stock price. But will VIAC stock continue its downward trajectory over the coming weeks, or is a recovery in the stock more likely?|wallstreetbets|VIAC is a next good buy?|28.0|0.67

This is already a no-brain play. The price of the stock has been suppressed for weeks by shorts and it is a ticking time bomb. B

Even the CEO has said these analysts should kill themselves.

The price of steel is at an all time high which means that the profit margins of companies lik CLF, who are vertically integrated with mining, processing, and producing are higher than ever. 

Let's take a look at the options chains

EXPIRING THIS WEEK:

8,000 OPEN INTEREST ITM CALLS EXPIRING
24,000 OPEN INTERESTED OTM CALLS EXPIRING WITHIN 10% price difference.

EXPIRING NEXT WEEK:

30K ITM
30K OTM WITHIN 10%

With a 10.123B market cap @ 20.27 a share we are looking at 500M shares.

WITH THE CALLS EXPIRING WE ARE LOOKING AT 6,000,000 SHARES ALONE WHICH EQUALS MORE THAN 10% OF THE FLOAT.

With a realistic price target set 20% higher than current price, and a massive surge in options being exercised within 10%, I'm expecting a share price of AT LEAST $30 short term. I'm surprised this stock hasn't had more publicity in forums personally so I thought I'd add onto the post I saw earlier.

Some bad press for Lordstown tho, they are running low on cash and might not met their deadlines.

Electric vehicle start-up Lordstown Motors said Tuesday it does not have enough money to start commercial production and runs the risk of failing as a business, sending its stock tumbling.

The company on Tuesday amended its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission to say in one year it may no longer function as ‚Äúa going concern‚Äù.

The company said that with its current cash and cash equivalents of $587m as of the end of the first quarter, it did not have enough funding to launch the Endurance, an electric pick-up truck geared toward commercial operators.

Smile direct

SmileDirectClub (NASDAQ:SDC) rose ~14.5% today recording its steepest one-day gain since January.

However, as shown in the graph, the shares remain ~30.2% lower in the year so far underperforming the rival Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) which has gained ~1.6% today.

Recently, JPMorgan downgraded SmileDirectClub to neutral from overweight noting its worse than expected guidance. The price target was also lowered by $4.00 to $10.00 per share.

In early May, SmileDirectClub fell in reaction to a cybersecurity incident that forced the company to estimate $10 - $15M of revenue impact for Q2 2021.

Meanwhile, Seeking Alpha contributors have mixed views on the stock with a bullish and neutral rating given by two analysts over the past 90-day period.

SA contributor The Value Trend thinks that SmileDirectClub is worth at least $16.00 per share noting that the company is ‚Äúwell-poised to achieve management's growth and profitability expectations.‚Äù They also have a new bus travelling the uk so they should bring in some customers.

Aeva

Aeva Technologies, Inc.

Lumentum Holdings Inc.

""As high-capacity and cost-effective optical solutions are critical to 5G and next-generation mobile networks, we are excited to participate in defining industry requirements which will both help the industry advance and increase the market opportunities for our highly differentiated full-band tunable pluggable transceiver platform,"" said Justin Abbott, Lumentum Director of Product Line Management, Transmission. ""Lumentum has a long history of innovation in high-speed full-band tunable pluggable transceivers, pioneering the category more than a decade ago. We are well-positioned to meet customer needs in 5G and next-generation mobile networks.""

Driven by the broad global 5G buildouts, MOPA aims to accomplish a common view and understanding in the industry regarding which optical solutions are required for 5G transport, such as fronthaul and backhaul. This serves to improve the current challenge for operators, system vendors, and optical pluggable suppliers to make the right technology choices and focus on the most relevant needs. MOPA benefits the ecosystem to ensure timely, cost-efficient, and optimized architectures.

For the first time as a joint industry initiative, the MOPA paper describes common optical requirements for mobile transport networks. It includes Mobile Optical Blueprints, which are network solution descriptions documenting use cases with the optical pluggable and passive optical components, such as wavelength division multiplexing and optical power splitter implementing these use cases, with high-level optical requirements."|wallstreetbets|Lumentum Partners With Ericsson, Nokia, And Other Industry Participants (NOK DD)|29.0|0.71

So let's break this shit down

CLOV still has a massive short interest reported up to 45% which could be around 49 m

Insiders Hold a majority of the float we can say at least 50% (because i dont know the true numbers) and it is locked untill share prices reach 30 for 90 days Leaving around 56 million shares truly available.

We have in 2 days of trading completely torn through the entire options chain and have a massive amount of calls ITM. If someone can help me with exact numbers i haven't been able to find it.

So this morning we have around 56 million shares that can be traded and potentially short around 50 million shares as well, we Also have At least 20 million shares ITM on contracts below 15$ strike prices with and absolute shitload of Contracts 16-22 ITM.

Today they look to be releasing new contracts with strike prices in 1$ increments from 23-40$.

What this means today and how we can run a train on some dummies.

Lets say those folks exercise their contracts if they are 15$ and under all the while more apes pile on buying new contracts, buying more shares and diamond handing the fuck out of that shit. It should cause a massive squeeze with the pressure from all sides as ITM contracts are at the head of the train, with the new shares and new contracts going up the coot coot and poop shoot.

# Why?

$CLF AKA Cleveland Cliffs is one of the **largest producers of steel in america.**

Have you tried building a house? Getting gym gear? Did you try to get a huge infrastructure plan going for the US which includes streets, bridges, buildings and what not all built with steel? anything to do with steel **GOT FUCKING EXPENSIVE.**

**Because Steel is in huge demand, because now that covid is falling back, people want to buy stuff, build stuff and all needs steel. Steel prices went to the moon! THEY FUCKING TRIPLED!**

üåè üöÄ üåï

&amp;#x200B;

[In a matter of months prices for steel TRIPLED](https://preview.redd.it/bir35uvtt7471.jpg?width=653&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aecc3e0e75d8551b90c57135f81c186c0ecc152b)

&amp;#x200B;

# WHY $CLF?

# Because $CLF is a big fucking steel producer, profitable, undervalued as fuck, forecast EBIDTA of $5.6B at a share price of 20$! RIGHT NOW $CLF should be worth at LEAST 35$, and that's not even counting in that HRC prices are over 1600$

üöÄ

# SHORTS TRYING TO BEAT DOWN $CLF! üöÄ

# Look at the chart:

**Price of steel increases over 50% in the same time, but CLF just trades 2$ higher than it did nearly 6 months ago? HOW is that possible?!**

&amp;#x200B;

[2$ in nearly 6 months while the product increases over 50&amp;#37; in price in the same time?!](https://preview.redd.it/uztdva1yt7471.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c97042edaaa86ab560ecb5b3df38357913928cd5)

&amp;#x200B;

How do you explain, that a company that is this big, produces steel for whole america and where the **product price was raised by 50% and PEOPLE ARE STILL GRABBING IT LIKE ITS BLACK FRIDAY**.

&amp;#x200B;

Waiting times on steel orders for big companies are as **over 3 MONTHS** and more with the buyers paying any price the company wants. **That means with the same steel output the company now EARNS 50% MORE per ton of steel than it did in january!**

But the share price only rose 2$ since january, just about 10%? Do you see the problem?? CLF should AT LEAST be trading at 50% more than in january, but obviously, because a company has basic costs (running a furnace, personnel et cetera) - but at some point, with EVERY DOLLAR MORE THE PRODUCT COSTS, THE COMPANY WILL EARN DIRECTLY.

üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

Let's say producing a ton of steel costs 500$ in total. If the price of a ton goes to 750, to company makes 250$ profit. If the price goes to 1000$, the company instantly **doubles** it profit, with the steel price just increasing by 50%. Now if the steel price goes to 1500!, the company could make 1000$ profit. **Price doubled from 750$ per tonne, but PROFIT QUADRUPLED!**

Obviously there's a bit more to that, but that's the gist.

# WHY CLF - A CHAD CEO üöÄ üöÄ :

# CEO LOURENCO GONCALVES is a fucking stud. HE knows the analysts are wrong and he KNOWS that people are shorting his company. And he WANTS TO FUCKING FUCK EM.

google CLF earnings call transcript

Read what he tells to journalists and analysts:

""**And then you say, well, Lourenco, the clients are complaining that they are not receiving steel. Yes**\[...\]. So they are basically collecting what they pointed for and we are taking good care of some of them, **some others we are not taking care** because I don't believe that they don't, they really even belong.""

**THEY JUST FUCKING DONT CARE about people complaining the prices are too high.**

""**Because we don't need all of this ""opportunistic"" players in the marketplace. They just destroy, complicate, gossip, talk on the phone, send fake information, do everything that we only done in the marketplace.** \[...\]. **So that's what we were working for. We are doing our mandate. We are doing our job. We are working on behalf of the shareholders of the company.**

I won't bore you with a ton of numbers that shows that **CLF is profitable** as FUCK, **undervalued** AS FUCK, have a ton of **CASH** and **shorts fucking with them** all the time. Look at the chart and tell me there is no reason with INSANE steel prices the **stock trades at JANUARY levels.**

üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

# TLDR: üöÄ

# $CLF is an american company that makes BANK, earns tons of money because steel prices went through the roof and are still trading at levels they were in january, but the product costs 50% more than it did in january. Their CEO is HELLBENT on crushing shortsellers and bad analysts.

# Fair price of $CLF should be at least 35$-40$.

Positions: tons of german call warrants, a load of July 20c calls, Oct 22c calls. About to add more. Obviously no financial advice, I just like the stock.

It‚Äôs time we talk about POPEYES. IF YOU DON‚ÄôT LIKE READING, SKIP TO THE GAME PLAN AT THE END. The best frickin‚Äô chicken sandwich on the face of the earth and frankly much better chicken than Wendy‚Äôs (sorry, but it‚Äôs true). They also have fabulous rice and tendies. Not to mention their french fries fry the competition. Point is: it‚Äôs freaking delicious. Remember when people killed each other over the chicken sandwiches? Yeah. Supply and demand, bitches.

Here‚Äôs the skivvy: Popeye‚Äôs was bought by Restaurant Brands International ($QSR) in 2017, a Canadian corporation that also owns Burger King and Tim Horton‚Äôs. We have QSR to thank for the chicken sandwiches, so they aren‚Äôt totally incompetent. Popeyes is an objectively better restaurant than Tim Horton‚Äôs and Burger King. Not that Burger King and Horton‚Äôs are bad, but Popeye‚Äôs bears far greater growth prospects. All Burger King and Horton‚Äôs locations really should become joint Popeyes locations (i.e. selling Popeye‚Äôs kush in addition to whatever was going on) - there‚Äôs strong synergy between donuts and Chicken (Oooo that sounds freaking good - a donut chicken breakfast sandwhich). Anyway, this doesn‚Äôt need to happen for QSR to go to the moon, but it really should happen to boost the BK and Horton laggards. 

Here‚Äôs what makes QSR attractive: Popeye‚Äôs, if you haven‚Äôt already guessed!

Popeye‚Äôs major growth is in overseas expansion:

Popeye‚Äôs currently has 3,400 stores worldwide. People everywhere want to open Popeyes franchises. QSR needs to get the logistics capacity and reach to let them do so in all parts of the world, and they are *steadily* entering new countries each year. They need to turbocharge this, and issuing more shares at a higher stock price will help them do so. 

ASIA - KFC has become a cultural staple in China, which has over 7,000 stores. But, 
as we all know, Popeye‚Äôs has objectively better chicken than KFC - THE KERNEL IS NO MATCH FOR THE FREAKING POPE! There‚Äôs tremendous growth opportunity there to become the dominant chicken chain. $QSR has the meek goal of getting 1,500 stores in China in the next decade, which alone is a 50% increase in the number of total stores! [1] Our goal: make every KFC in China into a Popeyes. Or just have a Popeye‚Äôs for every KFC in China. Either way, chicken domination.

Popeye‚Äôs Shanghai opening saw a huge crowd of like 2,000+ people who waited hours in line. [1] There‚Äôs already a following. Who missed the infamous chicken sandwich wars on Twitter? 

There‚Äôs also plans to open a few hundred stores in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. [2]

UK &amp;amp; EUROPE - Popeyes is entering UK in 2021 aiming for 350 stores in the next decade, which builds on successful entry into Spain &amp;amp; Switzerland in last two years. [3].


***OTHER ATTRACTIVE QUALITIES***:
The Popeye‚Äôs twitter account is bomb. Chicken. Sandwich. Wars. 

Popeye‚Äôs was Anthony Bourdain‚Äôs (RIP) favorite chain restaurant. 

Chicken is a much better meat for the environment than cow and pig meat, requiring 1/8th and 1/4th respectively the energy to produce per gram [5]. Also less space required, less religious dietary restrictions on chicken. Lab grown chicken meat *may* more readily resemble chicken-chicken texture, i.e it‚Äôs probably going to be harder to get cow and pig cells to differentiate into the various relative compositions and arrangements of the preferred meat, while chicken breast is mostly one cell type (I am speculating on this last sentence). Shrimp also bear some ecological promise. 

OTHERWISE: $QSR has propagated rumors in the recent past (2019) to buy a FOURTH restaurant chain [4] - see source. If the stock price rises enough, they could issue more shares to acquire the capital to do so. 

THE GAMEPLAN: buy QSR shares. Get price high enough (100ish?) to have them issue more shares to buy a FOURTH restaurant chain. Advocate most locations of Tim Horton‚Äôs and Burger King be made joint Popeye‚Äôs locations, and advocate a freaking chicken donut sandwich - New. Internet. Sensation. Breakfast menu with monte-cristo like thing would also be bomb. Perhaps a burger with chicken for buns would be good too? Hm. After successfully buying a fourth restaurant chain and the other above proposals, QSR should change its listing to POPE, because Popeyes is the POPE of chicken. 

SO: Are you in, or are you chicken?

Disclosures: I bought $100 in QSR around $65. Might buy a lot more soon.

There‚Äôs not much here for a short squeeze. I just freaking love Popeye‚Äôs. idk about Horton‚Äôs and Burger King, I just see them as potential Popeye‚Äôs locations (again, not closing them - just selling Popeyes stuff there too.).

Sitting right at the top of the Bollinger band, strong signal that the upside will continue. Still large volume today and yesterday means that the \~$15-16 USD range is going to act as a strong base for us going forward.  
200DMA moving upwards, Bollinger Bands slightly still expanding, looks bullish. 

The hourly chart will paint us a better picture for our baseline.  


https://preview.redd.it/yk78c534e6471.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f31b4e32c5bd961cdfd1b9f7813cd60e8c965d62

MASSIVE wall at 14.50, just as I've been strongly stating throughout this run. It acted as the signal to the upside on the left arrow, when we sold off it acted as support with a strong bounce, and again another test and won back.   
14.50 will continue to be acting as strong support moving forward, if we fail a test at 14.50 I would expect 12.10 to come.

Bollinger Bands are tightening again indicating price movement is imminent. This can be in part of the fact of the BB Investor Information Seminar tomorrow  
([https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors)) 

### Baird 2021 Global Consumer, Technology &amp; Services Conference

I doubt anything huge will be announced here but more information is always better.  
RSI looking healthy.  


https://preview.redd.it/iu895vv4e6471.png?width=1860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90999fa1816c8ea8283277413e0e09705172a2f7

Upwards wedge appears to be forming and lines up nicely with the Bollinger Bands. There will be movement either tomorrow or Thursday I am expecting a  20% pop to the upside.  
A lot of calls at $15 this week, expect to stay above this with all the strength and momentum BB is showing right now.  


Immediate resistance shows \~$17.20 USD. Acted as support in the January run on the 25th and 26th but now is acting as a strong wall. After $17.20, $20 is easily in sight.

  
Reducing my EOW target of $24-33 to $20-24, to stay conservative, though one solid piece of news tomorrow can make the difference.  


Volume is critical. Definitely has slowed down Friday Monday and again today but eyes are still on us. This is technically speaking this is great play right now, run up hard with a healthy pullback into a cup and handle. Strong baseline which is pushing higher highs and higher lows. Massive support at 14.50 with strong upside potential. Easy 50% gains if volume comes back  
Still extremely bullish.

Take care, and stay healthy."|wallstreetbets|$BB - Expect Large Movements Within 1 Month - Part 7|1311.0|0.82

I started to notice that the big money was trading daily in Jan 22 50p and it got me wondering if this was an actual strategy to use the MM to indirectly drive the price down and wanted to get WSB's thoughts.

I found this online:

&gt;The purchasing of a put almost always results in some amount of shares of the underlying stock being sold. The amount of puts bought and their delta determines the amount of shares sold. For example- Stock XYZ is trading at $50. Speculator comes in and purchases 100 puts with a $50 strike pirce (representing the right to put 10,000 shares of XYZ at $50 to the put seller). In this case, the put seller on the transaction is a market maker, which is indeed the case in the vast majority of options trades. The option seller just took a risk position equal to being long 5000 shares of XYZ- 100 puts, representing 10,000 shares, with a 50 delta. To hedge this trade then, the market maker will sell 5000 shares of XYZ. If XYZ is a highly liquid stock, this may have no real effect. If XYX is not very liquid, this hedge will move the stock price down. Put purchases put a net downward effect on stock price, the only question is magnitude.

Oddly the trades of the Jan 22 50p generally lead the daily Notional Dollar Amount and when they're heavy buys the stock tanks.  Is it plausible that this is a way for a fund to ""short"" the stock via the MM?  Watching some of the other options activity has me wondering if the strategy has been to short the stock, buy the puts and sell the call spreads but maybe I need to take off my tinfoil hat.

Recently, I have seen a lot of inaccurate information being spread that CLOV is a trap set out by the hedgefunds due to CITADEL stake in CLOV but this was just debunked as they have even a larger stake in AMC.

$CLOV

Data for CLOV from FINRA shows that on May 24, 2021, short interest was 36.11% of the float which is very high.  Data provided by ORTEX shows that short interest just this Friday was 42.58%. This  increased to 44.31% on Monday and yesterday's (Tuesday June 8) data was at 45.56% which is another INCREASE in the short interest. 

Even though the stock has sky rocketed in value, the SHORT INTEREST of the free float has NOT DECLINED meaning that a short squeeze has not occurred! Shorts currently are not covering their position. The recent gains in CLOV's stock price is purely from retail investors like us piling in.

If we continue to increase the share price of CLOV, then we will see a HUGE short squeeze and with the short interest of over 40%, that's going to be a very violent move and the return is going to be more that we can imagine! Considering the insane volume of 725 Million yesterday and the fact that it is the most mentioned ticker on WSB yesterday, there is definitely a lot of retail investors piling into CLOV to create a short squeeze.

If everything continues like this with the stock price increasing,  putting more pressure on the shorts, CLOV could ultimately squeeze at a much higher price!

# Why I like them (can skip to Memeability):

* Top Tier Customer Service - Quotes from Reddit Users (it's publicly posted, but still don't want to call individual people out)
   * "" I like the stock. Chewy sent me flowers and a signed card when they learned that my dogs passed away. I didn't even ask for sympathy but it made me cry. I really do like the stock.""
   * "" They really do have great customer service. We ordered a sweater for one of our dogs and it was too big so we processed an exchange. They contacted us and told us to keep it and suggested we donate it to a shelter.""
   * "" I used Chewy for regular shipments of food for my dog ‚Äî which was either cheaper than or unavailable on Amazon ‚Äî and when he died, I forgot to cancel the auto-renewal a day or two later. The customer service rep gave me his condolences, refunded the charge, and suggested I donate the food to a local shelter in my dog‚Äôs name. It meant a lot to me. ""
* Q4 Performance Beats Expectations
   * 2020 Rev: $7.15B (+47% Y/Y vs +37% expectations) - strong performance through COVID - most likely some stickiness as COVID situation improves
   * First quarterly profit in Q420: +222% vs expectations (small base though - it's not that great, just means prove they can be profitable whenever needed), beats previous quarters as well
* Increased 2021 Guidance
   * FY21 $8.85B - $8.95B (+24%-25% Y/Y) vs prior $8.8B estimate
* Petsmart has a majority stake (\~63.5%) - less risk
* They've been beat down from a high of $120 (YTD) - Incoming Tech recovery (fingers crossed) should be nice help (someone can probably help explain the TA better)

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of ‚ÄúMyHealth‚Äù now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent ‚ÄúMyHealth‚Äù acquisition.¬†

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick &amp; West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

Sector: Energy

Industry: Oil &amp; Gas Refining &amp; Marketing

Market cap: [1.97B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLNE?p=CLNE)

Clean Energy is a leading renewable energy company focused on the procurement and distribution of renewable natural gas, and conventional natural gas, in the form of compressed natural gas, and liquefied natural gas for the United States and Canadian transportation markets. Renewable natural gas, which is delivered as either compressed or liquified natural gas, is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring, environmentally detrimental waste methane, or biogas, from non-fossil fuel sources‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâsuch as dairy and other livestock waste and landfills‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâfor beneficial use as a replacement for fossil-based transportation fuels.

**BULL ARGUMENT**

Clean Energy is focused on developing, owning, and operating dairy and other livestock waste projects and supplying renewable natural gas (procured from their own projects or from third parties) to their customers in the heavy and medium-duty commercial transportation sector. Clean Energy has participated in the alternative vehicle fuels industry for over 20 years and will argue they are the largest U.S. provider of renewable natural gas for commercial transportation. Clean Energy is in a unique position because valuable Environmental Credits are generated by the party that dispenses renewable natural gas into vehicle fuel tanks, and they have access to more dispensers than any other market participant.

As a comprehensive clean energy solutions provider, Clean Energy:

* designs and builds, as well as operates and maintains, public and private vehicle fleet customer stations in the United States and Canada
* sells and services compressors and other equipment used in renewable natural gas production and at fueling stations
* transports and sells their fuels via ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù natural gas pipelines and interconnects
* sells U.S. federal, state and local government credits, which they collectively refer to as Environmental Credits, they generate by selling renewable natural gas as a vehicle fuel
* obtains federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives

On April 19, 2021, Clean Energy announced an [agreement with Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-agreement-with-amazon-for-low-and-negative-carbon-rng-01618826728?tesla=y) to provide low and negative carbon RNG. Fuel will be provided at 27 existing Clean Energy fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations by the end of the year. This will provide renewable natural gas in 15 different states. Additionally, on May 11, 2021, Chevron announced they were investing an additional $20M in the [Adopt-a-Port initiative](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chevron-clean-energy-fuels-extend-adopt-a-port-initiative-to-reduce-emissions-01620727503?tesla=y) with Clean Energy to provide cleaner, more carbon-negative renewable natural gas.

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

Clean Energy began to see the negative effects of COVID-19 on volumes delivered in mid-March 2020 and continued to see declines in volumes delivered through December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019. Their volumes bottomed in the second quarter of 2020 and improved through year-end albeit at a slower pace than expected, with volumes delivered for the fourth quarter of 2020 increasing 7% over the second quarter of 2020. While volumes delivered in December 2020 were 2% lower compared to December 2019, this decline was lower than the decline of 4% when comparing September 2020 to September 2019. The most significant negative effects of COVID-19 in relation to Clean Energy volumes were experienced in the airports (fleet services) and public transit customer markets, which were down by between 15% and 31% during 2020 compared to 2019 due to federal, state and local government mandates to restrict normal daily activities, as well as travel bans, quarantines and ‚Äúshelter-in-place‚Äù orders.

Other risk factors Clean Energy may face include:

* The willingness of fleets and other consumers to adopt Clean Energy vehicle fuels, which may be influenced by certain of the factors, many of which are beyond their control.
* Competition in the market for vehicle fuels generally, and the nature and effect of competitive developments in the market
* Suppliers‚Äô ability to successfully develop and operate projects and produce expected volumes of renewable natural gas, particularly in light of a long and variable development cycle that requires significant resource commitments
* The potential commercial viability of livestock waste and dairy farm projects to produce renewable natural gas
* The development and production of vehicles and engines in key customer and geographic markets by vehicle and engine manufacturers, over which Clean Energy has no control

**CONCLUSION**

[According to Simplywall.st](https://preview.redd.it/bwl9boec16471.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad876df7da5412f5496a49e1d2e8bea321680254)

I am bullish on Clean Energy and I agree they are currently undervalued. Clean Energy serves fleet vehicle operators in a variety of markets, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, industrial and institutional energy users, and government fleets. I believe these fleet markets will continue to present a growth opportunity for Clean Energy vehicle fuels for the foreseeable future.

 The four firms own about 149 million shares of the outstanding shares. The total outstanding shares as of 3/31/2021 was 326,901,690 Class A shares and 69,587,138 Class B shares ( Class B is solely owned by Andrew Paradise, CEO). Current MC = 395 Million shares \* 23.2 = 9.19 Billion However, Andrew Paradise‚Äôs shares are not liquid i.e. they are locked up unless the firm does a secondary offering where he could to sell some. However, he just sold about 8 million in April which would make it less likely he will sell given the voting control he has. 

That means that total dollar value outstanding in the market is about 

326,901,690 \* 23.2 = $7.58 Billion

 Four largest firms own 149.79 million Shares or 149 million rounded. 

149 / 326,900,000 = 45.58% of shares outstanding 

Remaining shares 177,900,920 (i.e. conservative float) significantly less than the 237 million that is reported Short interest as of 5/14/2021 was 73,180,000 shares 

Real Short interest as a percent of float = 73,180,000 / 177,900,920 = 41.14% 

But directors and advisors also own an additional 32,571,629 shares in total of Class A shares Current Float = 177,900,920 ‚Äì 32,571,629 = 145,329,291

 REAL Short interest (% of float) = 73,180,000 / 145,329,291 = 50.35% 

Short Interest Price Target (totally random just for some estimate)

 I used market value liquid not including class B shares 

Low = Clov up from 1.7 billion mc to 4.86 billion = 3.16 Billion in market cap value 3.16 / 7.58 (dollar value out for SKLZ) = 41.68%  = $32.869

# Actual TL;DR - The timing of the 8k filing was unfortunate, but that's how CLNE operates, funding infrastructure. We got over that hump and are cruising toward the $13 break point now.

^(Disclaimer - not financial advice. I love you all and hope you find crispy tendies no matter which stonk you invest in.)

In case some of you retards have been sleeping off medication induced comas the last few days, let me update you on what the fuck's been going on with everyone's favorite mean, green, meme stock (though it's not really a meme stock, it's legit) Mr. CLeaN.... E....

&amp;#x200B;

* Traffic picks up on CLNE as people finally realize they're letting a golden opportunity pass by in both the short and long term investment departments
* The price picks up on its way to $13
* The company closes an 8k offering and starts up another
* People freak the fuck out
* Stock drops 7%
* **Beautiful diamond handed retards hodl the stock and buy more shares**
* No üåàüêª here folks
* The stock price recovers and blows past last week's high

# Just mopping up the hedgies and their short share bullshit.

CLNE's 8k filing was poorly timed, but realistically it had nothing to do with the rise in sentiment on reddit or anywhere else. The company choses to fund their infrastructure projects that way and the shareholders pay for it for a short time. This time, shareholders paid for it for a record short time (1 day).

I woke up this morning dejected. No, not because CLNE was low. I woke up dejected because my mom finished off my fruity pebbles last night and told me I couldn't buy anymore clover puts (thanks mom, by the way). It was bound to bounce back, and thanks to you diamond handed smooth brains it bounced back harder than before - and now I'm harder than ever.

The path forward is simple - buy share, hold shares. Circuit breakers will pop at each price level on the way up and shitadel and blackstone will eat shit for weeks. Tomorrow is going to be a beautiful day, and I'd love to hear what you think about it.

As a side note, there is something strangely sexual and weird about that gif posted above and I sincerely apologize for posting it.

The DD here is purely looking at WISH as a pure value play and doesn't include any short-squeeze related information.

# Business

To keep it simple,

1. Wish is a global e-commerce platform that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers.
2. It allows sellers to list their products on Wish and sell directly to consumers.
3. The merchants on the platform primarily offer ***unbranded products that are deeply discounted compared to the alternatives. Most of the merchants/products are from china.***
4. They target customers looking for value goods people with annual income &lt; 75,000 USD, plenty in US and Europe regions accounting for 90% of customers.
5. Wish does not stock the products themselves or manage returns.

# The Team

1. *CEO* [*Piotr Szulczewski*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Szulczewski) *a former Google Engineer*
2. *Exec chair - Jacky Reses (known for Square and works with Bill Ackman at Pershing square)*
3. *CTO - DannyZhang (Ex- Yahoo, ATT)*
4. *Best in class Technology team of engineers mostly from Facebook and Google*

Hunky dory there are so many e-commerce platforms why is WISH special ?

# Value Proposition

Looks at some of the stats here

[Activity Snapshot](https://preview.redd.it/hp99fuab85471.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14a48935ccd3b4142a9070ac354568d30eab0c10)

WISH platform connects over ***100 million monthly active users in over 100 countries to over 550k global merchants***. Their main motto is to give users an affordable, personalized, and entertaining shopping experience leveraging their in house data science and marketing technologies.

# Value Proposition to Wish Users

The platform excels from the rest by making e-commerce

**Affordable -** Offer unbranded products to value conscious customers at deep discounts

1. **Accessible -**  built as a Mobile first platform for access across the world in 40 different languages
2. **WISH Local -** Partner with 50,000 brick and mortar stores, use them as pick up facilities and also allowing the stores to list their products on the platform

The standout features of the shopping experience

1. **90% of user activity occurs through Mobile App**
2. ***Discovery Based***  **- 70% of the sales on the platform do not come from a search query, meaning the user doesn't come to the platform to buy something that's on his mind but rather ends up buying a product browsing through the platform liking a deal**
3. Their marketing programs are top notch and they use big data technologies and AI in their approach to make it highly personalized. They look at facebook, instagaram, emails and messages to customize their recommendations. ***ok most of you that have seen The social Dilemma on NFLX. you got it.***
4. user experience is engaging and entertaining by having highly personalized feeds. on an ***average users spent over \~ 9 minutes a day*** on their platform in 2020

# What's in for the merchants in addition to being able to sell their products ?

1. access to 100 mil monthly users across 100 countries, digital presence for their stores
2. Through **ProductBoost,** they are able to market their products by paying WISH as ad revenue. **This is very similar to a TinderBoost feature. 30% of merchants use this feature**
3. WISH charges and offers logistics ensuring consistent delivery experience boosting their sales.

# Revenue sources

1. **Core Marketplace** \~ commission on the products being sold on the platform
2. **ProductBoost** \~ marketing ad dollars coming from the merchants
3. **Logistics** \~ providing logistics support to the merchants and getting paid

# Cost and Expenses

They are spending truck loads of money on user acquisition and marketing costs juts like any other early stage e-commerce player. In the long term they expect to spend 40%\~45% of their revenue in this area

&amp;#x200B;

[Expected to be 40&amp;#37;\~45&amp;#37; going forward](https://preview.redd.it/vdxe4acke5471.png?width=393&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5dcbbfe8af527a2dc171ef2febb2a126481c6e9)

# Oppurtunitues Ahead

1. 43% of headcount involved in R&amp;D related activities. Huge opp to drive efficiencies at scale
2. 10,800 wish power users and influencers to market the platform, selected based on their social following, this would heavily propel the customers and merchants growth
3. with covid-19 easing across the world, logistical nightmares would be eased
4. Further scaling of Wish local to bring in more brick and mortar stores on the platform
5. Adding new product categories and higher value products as needed by customers
6. increased spending domestically in US due to monetary easing and stimulus
7. Very solid base of long term customers, look at the chart showing the life time value of the users  from the time they started engaging

# Valuation

WISH , still not profitable with an EBITDA loss for Q1 2020 in the range of -60 million equals \~7% sales.

The company doesn not have any financial debt, has \~ $1.5 to$ 2.0 B in cash.

**Looking at their price to sales multiple, the stock is at a heavy discount compared to its peers**

**As of close today,**

|Platform|Price to sales ratio|
|:-|:-|
|ETSY|11.6|
|SHOP|44.44|
|SFIX (stitchfix)|3.844|
|BABA|5.579|
|Avg. Price to sales of 75 Retail (online) sales, data from A.Damodaran from NYU stern|4.52|
|WISH|**2.861**|

with a modest price to sales multiple of 5x, the stock should be trading at \~$24 to be modestly valued compared to other E-Commerce firms.

***TLDR***

*WISH is an undervalued stock play, heavilty discounted compared to its peers. Any price below \~$15 is a joke.*

*I do not care about short interest, Gamma Squeeze but if it helps then bring it on. There were multiple rumors in the past that it's being acquired by Amazon, e-bay. I see institutional intrest to be coming back into the stock.*

*Not selling a single share (1,000 shares at $10.56 avg) until it hits \~45. Might as well hit 60 if there are more WISHes from here.*

$DKNG was the only pick out of the five maps chosen this evening. Its was on a steady decline form the end of March until midway through May, dropping from its all time high of $74.38 to around $43. Since then it has been able to pick itself back up to $55.30 as of today at closing. Tomorrow should be interesting, hopefully the trend continues.

From years of researching shorting strategies, WISH has all the makings of a monster squeeze. We have a controversial company with a compelling ticker name, virtually no debt, negative earnings, and huge growth rate. Ascribing fundamental value is difficult, and shorts can't wait out the company to go bankrupt because, well, there is virtually no debt. In a ZIRP world, you have the recipe for monster squeezes as the ceiling for fundamental value is dramatically above current prices.

1623205767.0|0.0|t3_nvl319|45.0|" Hello Monkeys,

I am not a big poster here, but I have tried to give advice where I can with the influx of new members to this sub. Some of you may remember me from my post ‚ÄúSome DD for you BB‚Äù. I hope at least a few of you listened to my advice and held through the tough couple months. If not, well sucks to be you. 

Today, I want to make a mention the shift into some of the newer meme stocks. Since the original BANG gang, new stocks have become quite popular around here. This includes but of course is not limited to CLOV, MVICS, and most recently WEN. 

With the introduction of the infamous twitter handle, Wendy‚Äôs, to the meme stock craze, I think it is important to mention that this is a shift into a whole new industry: the burger sector. What? There are burger stocks? Of course there are burger stocks you simps. I am not talking about other high cap stocks such as McDonalds, but rather the smaller guys with low float and high short interest such as BFI. 

I found it very strange that so little has been said about them on this sub with all the other shenanigans going on. Honestly, I see this play as more of a swing trade based on  technical analysis of the stock‚Äôs recent performance. But with the boom in Wendy‚Äôs  today, I would not be surprised if BFI spikes and follows suit. If you feel like you may have missed the boat with WEN, you may have a second chance here.  

If you are doing options, note that earnings are August 10ish. With all trades, if you are buying stocks, set your stop losses. If you get stuck bag holding, sell covered calls. If you don‚Äôt know what any of this means, check my older posts or send me a message.

TL:DR ‚Äì Wendy‚Äôs is bringing the burger biz into the meme, BFI is a good potential swing trade opportunity that may benefit from this madness. 

As always this is not financial advice. So would you kindly do your own research too

**OK APES IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING START TO THE SUMMER ALREADY AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET EVEN MORE INTERESTING**

All our favorite stocks in GME, AMC, BB, CLNE, CLOV, WKHS are spiking and it's a retard's dream come true. Only problem is that we seem to be a bit scattered currently with almost 7 different tickers being mentioned over and over again. Let's get straight to the point, we want to make money. (By the way I'm not a financial advisor and anyone that takes advice from me is probably retarded). Out of all the meme stocks, one stands out the most to me just because of fundamentals alone:

**CLNE.**

Now don't get me wrong, there's another certain stock that has to do with videogames which is shorted to oblivion and hedgies are absolutely fucked. But we're talking about Mr. Clean right now.

**How can this cow fart meme stock make me money you ask?**

Well, it's the only one with the government on our side. Mr. Biden is all about going green in the future and what better feel good story than turning cow fart into a natural gas that powers our vehicles? This crazy company actually devised a way to transition their product from traditional CNG or LNG to something they call ""Renewable Natural Gas"" (RNG).

**So how the fuck are they doing this??**

Let me explain. The landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, ranches etc. create methane. They use some of it to power their facilities, but then are left with a fuck ton of leftover methane which, until CLNE came around, they would just burn off into the environment at a GWP of 30. And that's not a good number for us. But our hero and savior CLNE takes the methane that's captured it and processes it into RNG, which they then transport to filling stations and use to fill up heavy transport vehicles. Those vehicles emit 1.1 GWP carbon, making them, technically, carbon negative. And who eats this shit up?? Amazon. Amazon recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG powered vehicles for their fleet. CLNE did something brilliant a few years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel these machines by building their refilling stations right next to Amazon's warehouses. Not only that but Amazon will be buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.

**Price**

The stock is currently trading around $10 because IB wants to keep it under $13 for the time being. I'm sure you guys have read the gamma squeeze potential coming up on 6/18 so I'm not going to go too deep into that. Basically if $CLNE hits $13 by June 18th, over 1.86 million shares become in the money for calls. And another 400,000 shares at 12, and 280,000 at 11, and 390,000 at 10. The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Clean Energy Fuels Corp have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 27.00 and a low estimate of 11.00

It's a company that's easily worth at least double what it's trading at right now but because of the small float it's pretty easy to manipulate. The IB's are fighting like hell to keep the price at 12.99 or lower which can be seen even in last week's last trading days where out of the total volume on Friday, 32% have have been sold short and it's an increase from Thursday where only 8% of the volume was sold short. That kept that spike from $9 to $11 from getting out of control for them.

**The Play?**

Shares. The small float means that shares can increase the price substantially causing IV to get bigger and makes the setup for the gamma squeeze that much more likely. And even if you don't play the squeeze at all, this company is still a no brainer in terms of being undervalued currently and I predict to be $20+ by EOY.

**TL;DR:** Cow farts go BRRRRRRR. Super undervalued company that has great potential in the future and actually has the fundamentals to support it.

That‚Äôs a good question. Let‚Äôs answer it.

# _____________________________________________________________________

1.) COVID vaccine rollout is almost over, and almost everybody in the United States who wanted a vaccine has gotten one. [63% of all U.S. adults have received at least one vaccine, deaths and case numbers are bearish](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home)

2.) **All** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) with social distancing and mask measures in place. The food services and concessions are back as well.

3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio. I‚Äôve already seen 5 movies at AMC since getting my first vaccine.

4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.

5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**

6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few months with fundraising, and increased profits in 2021.

7.) They will not go bankrupt. They have made it through this pandemic, and the light at the end of the tunnel is near.

8.) It‚Äôs extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there‚Äôs a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.

9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations, grow the business, and pay debt, using runway from stock sales. AMC just did this yesterday, and they can do it again if needed. Adam Aron is capitalizing on the situation to secure the long-term future of his company, and management is making the right decisions. **Dilution is not a bad thing.**

10.) Not only has bankruptcy been averted for AMC, but [**they also raised $587 million yesterday**. They can now start growing their company and eliminating burdens.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/03/amc-says-it-has-already-completed-share-offering-raises-587-million.html) Most of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.

11.) [AMC is about 20% shorted](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC)**, there is still good potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.

12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. This year is going to be [""the best year for movie releases in a long time""](https://time.com/6047564/summer-movies-2021/), with big releases like *F9*, *Shang-Chi &amp; The Legend of the 10 Rings*, *Black Widow*, *Nobody*, *A Quiet Place 2*, *Suicide Squad*, *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, *Cruella*, *Free Guy*, *Jungle Cruise*, *In The Heights*, and even more after summer. Both movies set to release in 2021 and 2020 are now releasing at the same time, so in one year there will be x2 as many movies to watch.

13.) AMC is dipping right now... these are discounted prices. **If you are going to buy, do it now**. A price point this cheap will never come again.

14.) GME hit $300 on a fucking squeeze. With strong fundamentals behind it as well, $AMC deserves a it's fair valuation. It's $AMC's turn.

15.) AMC has actually made money in [6/10 past years](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206962/net-income-of-amc-theatres/), in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, &amp; 2018. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)

*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*

16.) Without AMC there‚Äôs no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.

17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.

18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.

19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)

20.) **STONKS only go up.**

21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.

#22.) free popcorn

TL;DR : CEO is raising money to secure the long-term future of AMC. They can finance operations, grow their business, &amp; eliminate existing burdens. Vaccine rollout is advanced, and recovery is coming now. **People are returning to movies**. About 20% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.

Pandemic recovery &amp; squeeze combo.

Now, we all know these are not 100% known quantities as some things are happening behind closed doors (good job, SEC), but it's interesting to see that the more $BB has gone up, the more it is being shorted (scroll down to see it increasing every day on Fintel).

And what was silly at first has now become a real possibility for a $BB short squeeze happening. I believe it has gone from 9% to 24% since this push started.

This also helps explain how the movements of these stocks are so lockstep recently, especially $BB and $AMC. The hedge funds are acting on them in a similar fashion.

$GME's daily movement is similar but slightly different, likely as such a higher entry cost now.

Hey apes. New to posting DD so I‚Äôll do my best. I‚Äôve been trading for about 5 years and have through that time focused on TA. I have been an AMC ape since $15 and I don‚Äôt plan to sell any time soon.

To all the newer traders and apes reading, Technical Analysis is your best friend when we may feel a little unsure. It allows us to see where we have come from and where we are possibly going.

If we could for a moment zoom out on our charts and break out the crayons. Now I‚Äôd like you to go back to the lows from May 27th and trace a line following all the lowest candles leading to today. Looks nice and steady right? That‚Äôs called higher lows also known as a stair step. It‚Äôs a bullish move showing more buyers entering at higher prices with less sellers exiting at lower prices.

Now I want you to take that same crayon and go from our all time highs and trace it, making sure you‚Äôre following every tip of the highest candles. This is where we will see something that is great. Notice how all the candles are getting smaller? That‚Äôs consolidation. Consolidation is when buyers and sellers are settling into a range and waiting for a move in either direction. The fact that we are settling into a range at $50+ after running from $12 two weeks ago shows we are ok at these higher levels.

Now you may ask ‚Äúwhat happens when those two lines meet?‚Äù Great question. That is when we have a ‚Äúbreakout‚Äù this could be to the up or downside. I know that word downside is a little spooky so I‚Äôd like you to draw one more line. This will be a straight line following the $58.50 price level. This is our current level of resistance. What do you see? I see us testing is 3 different times since Friday. Though after every rejection we consolidate to a higher low.

Now that your chart is covered in scribbles, you may ask. ‚ÄúWhat does all of this mean?‚Äù This is a bullish indicator (bulls and apes are friends so don‚Äôt get spooked). This is showing that ideally in pre market or the early hours of the trading day tomorrow, we will see a breakout. I am personally bullish for the reason I just stated.

What happens if we do break out to the upside? Well we will ideally start entering into the $60 range. This will cause a bit of fomo and others who like technical analysis to jump in as we have confirmed a bullish break. This may lead to a further gamma squeeze and dare I say..... possibly margin call!?!?

TLDR: flat days and consolidation are a good healthy thing when you zoom out. It doesn‚Äôt matter if we go up .04 or 100k, I don‚Äôt plan to sell until Citadel is in a fucking soup line."|wallstreetbets|Bullish TA coming to fruition and extermination of FUD|5.0|0.56

McDonalds, Burger King, and all the 'better burgers' have been steadily pushing the tick up year after year to well beyond $10 a meal. Both by bumping the price on meals, and building out the side menu - drinks and desserts.

WEN has not even started at this. They have practically no premium drinking or deserts. If you walked into a WEN after one of the others - you would think half the menu is missing. Beyond that, WEN has the strongest position in terms of cheap eats.

Bottom line I think there is a lot they can do jack up same store sales, and the salad menu is inning 1 of this. Currently their growth is less than competitors and \*even after todays run\* are priced at a notable discount to peers based on valuation.

If WEN starts unlocking value, a fundamental case can be made for this to trade ballpark 35 - 45.

That said, I don't care about fundamentals - the bottleneck is meme potential.

I would be interested if anyone has hard date on ticker prices on WEN vs competitors. I am basing this on first-hand observation. Have not seen a ton of DD on this yet."|wallstreetbets|WEN - Wendy's ticket price and opportunity to unlock value|45.0|0.7

I believe it is a good buy right now instead of chasing meme stocks that have already exploded (if you're not already in it). Note: this stock has run up to 100+ in the past during the EV craze.

Afterhours today, QS broke out of the 31 resistance level which *confirms the uptrend* since having broken out of a wedge on the weekly chart. If 31 holds as support, the next resistance level is 37 and breakout considering it is shorted stock season.

**The nitty gritty:** QuantumScape is a multi-billion valuated company that IPO'd via special acquisition. They are simply an revolutionary growth EV battery maker with ties to the auto and tech industries. They are making process on development of their solid state battery to which if completed to standards they set, will render existing batteries incomparable due to how efficient it will be. They are aiming for 15min charge time and a larger range per charge. Their success could essentially mean the end of combustion engines in the future. Tesla's co-founder is on the Board of Directors for QS. Volkswagen is a 13D/A investor.

We are all part of something much more than a meme stock. We are against the short sellers and corrupt hedge funds that release a story to to destroy and manipulate the true value of your company. 

Health care is a HUGE issue here in the US, especially coming out of this pandemic, how can health care become more affordable to those who need it? Reduce risk and costs in the future for those who have life threatening diseases. What if it was you or your loved one? A open heart surgery costs over 1 million dollars. Clover health is here to solve these issues.

This is what you ASTRONAUTS are apart of.

First, their down about 15% from ath, they trade at a P/E of 10.5 yet their revenues and profit continue to consistently grow, they trade at a price to free cash flow of around 7, their aggressively buying back shares, and have a dividend yield of 2.55%, this is looking extremely undervalued and a fucking steal but when something looks this good I have to question why. Also, their at a 36 billion dollar market cap so it's not like their some giant that can't grow anymore.

Now for their actual business I understand their in the space of printers, computers, and stuff like that therefore I understand there was a large spike this year and the growth may not be sustainable for the next year but it doesn't mean that it should be at this low of a valuation.

Entry point is as important as exit. RKT is trading at a generous $22.30 in AH action. It's still under it's price-point pre-earnings calls and far below the all-time-high of $43 (technically $48 as it hit that in AH trading). Some quick facts:

* RKT option calls are still cheap (IV is at reasonable levels)
* Option chain goes up to $58.89
* Last time RKT rocketed up, it went right to the top of the option chain
* Lots of potential tendies to be made, for example, $1,750 worth of $30 contracts could be worth $140K if it goes up to the top of the option chain ($58.89)
* Even buying shares can potentially lead to a nice 2.64x mutliple on your investment!

Why now?

* Bullish pattern in today's trading and is up 20% this week
* It's trading pattern has been independant of other meme stocks, suggesting a potential break out
* Positive retail sentiment = It's in the top 10 trending stocks on stocktwits
* It's close to an inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 (Check this [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsanas/rkt_is_nearly_in_the_sp_500_did_some_research_and/) for more info)

Not to mention that RKT is fundamentally undervalued!

* Profitable each quarter
* P/E ratio of 4.8 vs 30+ for high growth companies in S&amp;P 500
* Dominant market position and insulated against interest rates because they are a workflow platform for brokers and therefore earnings are based more on the number of brokers on their platform rather than other metrics for traditional mortgage companies

In this screenshot below the amount of NCI is about 97% of Net Income. If you look at the most recent quarters the NCI is about 93%. Regardless of what it is RKT is slated to deliver 2021 EPS of around $2. Positive earnings for a company trading at a 9 P/E ratio (as of today) should be doing much better in this stock environment regardless of the NCI impact yet RKT continues to trade below it's fair value of a minimum $40 per share based on a 22 P/E ratio valuation which is the standard for S&amp;P. Regardless of all that, what the analysts are failing to discuss is this company is INSANLY profitable and can turn way higher EPS by the snap of it's fingers by decreasing the NCI. A mere 3% decrease could triple EPS. See my next screenshot for what the NCI is.

[screenshot per RKT 10k](https://preview.redd.it/oacouksut4471.png?width=1641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e0428fd23135785caeb6074397f3140762b0310)

The screenshot below describes per RKT annual 10k that RHI is a partnership owned 94% by  Dan Gilbert. This is also referred to as the class D shares that I have seen many other intelligent apes discuss. These class D shares give Dan and the C-Suite sweeping control over 70% of the voting stock giving them free rain to dictate the company as they see fit. In some cases this could be bad but in the case of RKT I see similarities to early day Amazon in the sense that 1) they are determined to take market share at whatever means necessary to win long term and 2) they actually have the ability to be insanely profitable if they choose to be but continue to reinvest the money in growing the business (i.e. their big marketing campaign we've all been seeing on TV).  Getting back to my point now on the 3%. If Dan Gilbert were to sell his shares (EDIT UPDATE) SELL HIS SHARES BACK TO THE COMPANY (i.e retire the shares decreasing shares outstanding making them treasury shares). This would then lower NCI while increasing EPS.

To summarize my two points RKT can triple their bottom line EPS by two easy ways if they wanted to 1) stop taking market share and deliver stellar earnings or 2) Dan can retire a mere 3% of his class D shares to squeeze every short out of their boxers.

I personally find this very compelling case to own shares of this company as they have proven they want to continue to grow top line revenue as best they can in the mortgage space before they begin to maximize profits. If either of these two events above occur on a fundamental basis would triple the EPS and therefore even at current P/E ratio valuation of 9 would send the stock up to $60 if their P/E would drop to 3. If the stock begins trading at S&amp;P valuation levels of 22 P/E ratio it would be around $120 per share without considering the other revenue streams growing by triple digits.

Bottom line: On a fundamental analysis looking at RKT it makes no sense why the stock is trading at the levels it's been at the past month. The bears are losing their only case now that the 10 year yield has fallen as you can see by the big gains these last few trading days. I appreciate all of the other analysis done on a technical level by the other apes.

The foundation:

- China threatening to ban tutoring was a market-shock for tutoring companies. Of course, China isn't going to ban tutoring and after months of this stock trading like it's going out of business they are finally starting to relieve pressure by admitting that they aren't going to outright ban tutoring. 

- The volume of panic selling is drying up and institutional investors are adding to their stack. There is large institutional incentive for a reversal. Short interest is high and almost 100% in the money. There is now a perfect storm for the case of a reversal, the same way there was a perfect storm for the crash. 

- Reversal plays like WISH are hot because panic selling and short interest presents an opportunity. A lot of interests have eyes on TAL and waiting for it to establish some type of bottom / indicator of recovery before reentry.

Financial Disclosure At End. That Includes One Day Gains

STAR - iStar Inc is a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a market cap of 1.28 billion dollars, their primary focus is on ground leasing. There are examples below where STAR gets their revenue under these circumstances of ground leasing. They do through their subsidiary of SafeHold. (STAR owns 2/3s of SafeHold)

1. A factory in need of cash. The factory will sell the land under their factory to STAR and then STAR will lease it back to the factory. (49% of revenue figure include net leasing)
2. STAR purchases raw land, develops the land and leases or sells the land to a new business. (33% of revenue this number includes residential)

For those interested in how financially strong their ground leasing subsidiary is. You can find their financials on yahoo finance below.[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SAFE/financials?p=SAFE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SAFE/financials?p=SAFE)

STAR is also involved in residential development and is currently building out one development with 3500+ homes and another massive development in the pipeline with an estimated 16450 homes with over 700 acres of industrial/commerical development. The average sale price of homes sold by STAR is above 500k. (Source: [https://www.istar.com/our-businesses/other-businesses/](https://www.istar.com/our-businesses/other-businesses/))

&amp;#x200B;

STAR also provides other financing services to home buyers and business owners. (12% of revenue)

&amp;#x200B;

Before the pandemic STAR was an exceptional company that flourished with high earnings and I admit they have seen better days. However, I firmly believe the bad days are behind them now with nearly 10+ billion dollars in revenue in the pipeline from just residential development. I am placing a target price of $22.75 without any WSB fuckery. They also recently increased their quarterly dividend to $0.125 to common stock holders. That is 50 cents a year just sitting on the stock. That is why it's marketed to mutual funds and ETFs as a relatively safe security.

Below is a one week chart of $STAR. After market today is currently sitting at $17.95 as of 06/08/2021. (This can also be seen in my financial disclosure at the bottom.

[One week chart Source: Ortex.com](https://preview.redd.it/o8ak2dl025471.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b88183f82f8f38160678aa75d8202087d3eca86)

Now, what first attracted me to STAR was its short interest. I know. I know. Oh god another short squeeze bullshit pitch. Tough shit, I think everyone and their Pewdiepie watching 9 year old child is looking for the next meme stock.

Now is there a potential squeeze situation here. The fuck if I know. But I will get into some key factors and you can make up your own bloody ape minds.

STAR has a total 70.24M shares in float or the number of shares that are currently available to the market.

Of those shares 20.79% or 14.6 million are shorted. These are the exchange reported numbers provided by Ortex. However, Ortex estimates the true number of shares shorted is 15.79 million. (Source Ortex and Images Provided Below)

&amp;#x200B;

Getting to how Mutual Funds and ETFs play a large part in any potential short squeeze. Of all shares in float 31.39% are held by ETFs and mutual funds. (Source: [https://www.etfchannel.com/etfs/?symbol=star](https://www.etfchannel.com/etfs/?symbol=star)) Image provided below.

These 22.04 million shares are essentially locked away from the shorts. There is only 1 way for the shorts to gain access to these shares and that is to buy up all outstanding shares in each mutual fund/ETF and force redemption. That is unlikely. For example, IJR is the largest holder of STAR among the ETFs and it's worth over 72 billion dollars. (Source: [https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/ijr/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/ijr/))

[Source: ETFchannel.com](https://preview.redd.it/0uwjpwx5x4471.png?width=417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23cfa15b9229959221e320381b7fc47fbd79555a)

With 22.04 million shares and ever increasing with cash inflows into mutual funds and ETFs. Yes, these funds are purchasing a steady supply each day due to cash inflow into their funds. Let us exclude these 22.04 million shares from float for the sake of the argument.

The real floated shares can be estimated to be 48.2 million shares and the short interest just above 30%.

The daily average volume traded is about 950k shares. Most of the buying is conducted by ETFs and mutual funds. Now let us say there was an increase in share price to $20. The shorts may start to cover their position. But they won't be able to do it fast enough with the trading volume available to them. They would need to recover 14.6 million shares when the daily average volume is 950k that is dominated by purchases by ETFs and Mutual Funds. That would take them weeks of purchasing to cover during a normal trading environment.  All while the share price continue to climb due to increased buying pressure. Melt up. Below is an image of how long it took the shorts to build up their short interest.

Hedgies would have to fight each other for the shares. (Someone go make some memes of Hedgies fighting each other)

This part is only speculation. I find it shameful that asset management firms would purposely include stocks that are being heavily shorted and manipulated into mutual funds that are marketed to seniors. I believe the intent is to profit without the retail investor realizing it through dilution in mutual funds. (Again just speculation)

Note that this is no financial advice. It only expresses basic economics.

***Monetary policy - Inflation and reference rate***

For those without economic background, let me remind that high periods of inflation (above the 2% target) will trigger an increase in the reference rate in order to reduce money supply and bring back inflation to its accepted level (between 0%-2%). Without going into the details, increase in reference rate will transfer to commercial banks and, eventually, increase (variable) mortgage rates.

***Current situation in the US***

Looking at the time series of M2 supply, you can observe that M2 in the US is going through the roof, which has already generated a surge in inflation (4.2% in April 2021 against 0.3% in April 2020). If inflation remains at such high level, the FED will have no choice but to increase the reference rate, which will increase mortgage rates. This will affect clients with variable mortgage rate and roll-over fixed rate contracts.

Michael Burry (known for The Big Short) is betting on this and has puts on T-bills. Why? because an increase in interest rate will decrease bond prices (recall the price of a bond is the Net PV of cash flows, blablabla).

***Client's probability of default at loan origination***

Banks (or loan providers) estimate the probability of defaults (PD), where variables are for example income/affordability because they are good measures to know if the client can repay the loan. Usually, credit officers will calculate the PD with a buffer on interest rate (high interest rate means higher monthly payments which decreases the client's creditworthiness) to give some room in case of increases in interest rate. High income/affordability means good creditworthiness ofc

***Interest rate hikes, PD and demand for properties***

But what happens if inflation increases so much that reference rate is pushed very high? The risk is that the above mentioned buffer (if even existing at loan approval) will not be sufficient to absorb the hikes and clients with variable mortgage rates and roll-over loans will not be able to pay back. Contracts become junk contracts because the underlying client is defaulting.

If the general PD increases due to a major sytemic shock (e.g. significan increase in interest rate), there are two effects: a portion of clients will default and properties will be liquidated on the market, which increases the supply. Second, higher interest rate means higher rents. Hence, fewer clients will be able to afford the loans and therefore the demand for properties will decrease. More supply coupled with less demand necessarily leads to a decrease in house price index.

***Summary:***

Low increase in mortgage rates can be beneficial, yes. But if inflation keeps increasing at this speed and level, we can expect significant increases in reference rate. If increases are significant, some clients will defaults, others will not be able to access new loans, which will increase supply and decrease demand for properties, respectively. I am sure you get it, this situation is terrible for companies operating in mortgage business."|wallstreetbets|UWMC - What inflation and interest rate mean for profits in mortgage business|155.0|0.82

Shorting is a perfectly legitimate (and necessary) tool used by traders to smooth price data. It helps to remove price volatility (price spikes) and thereby makes stocks more attractive to larger pools of buyers. Less volatile, more predictable, more attractive...

&amp;#x200B;

So how does it work... Let's say that the price of bananas is going up and you think that this situation won't last very long. So, you want to sell some bananas, but you don't have any. All of a sudden, a banker whispers in your ear, ""I'll lend you some bananas to sell right now, but you have to pay interest, and you have to give my bananas back soon."" So, you sell his bananas, make a big profit, and buy them back later at a lower price. Everything worked great... You made money, the banker made money (and has his bananas back), and the people buying bananas are buying them at lower prices now. But, what if that banker wants to make you the banana loan, but can't find the bananas to loan you. This is where your shorts get naked.

&amp;#x200B;

Before we go any further, we need to make a change... Imagine that, instead of getting bananas when you buy them, they go onto your ledger. So all you really see is a count of your bananas on a piece of paper. After all, that's how the stock market works these days...

&amp;#x200B;

Now back to the transaction... You want to sell bananas, your banker wants to loan them to you, but can't find any. So since this is all just on a ledger, the banker gives you a naked banana. It doesn't really exist, but it goes on your ledger anyway as a real banana. Elated that you have found 'bananas', you sell and make money. What should happen is that the banker should replace that naked banana with a real banana asap. But does he??? That might get expensive and this is all just on a ledger. So, if your banker doesn't really have to replace the bananas, does he?

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might be saying, ""so what, it doesn't affect me."" Not so fast. Now, between bananas and naked bananas, there are a lot of bananas on the market. This reduces the price of bananas. You say, ""woohoo, that's great."" But what if your pension fund or 401k is heavily invested in bananas. All of a sudden, everyone with bananas in their portfolio sees a deflating effect to their portfolios. You ask, ""where did all my bananas go?"" They went to that short seller and his banker, and they came from everyone who went long on (owns) bananas!

&amp;#x200B;

So, the moral of this story. Irresponsible naked shorting deflates stock prices and the portfolio values of those involved with the affected stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

But, that's not the end. That leaves us at share lending. There is a lynch-pin that makes this all possible and that is share lending. Remember, that someone had to loan the seller a share to sell and make that short sale. On a larger scale, that comes from everyone who owns shares. Here's the paradox of share lending.

&amp;#x200B;

Shareholders want share price to go up. At the same time, they loan their shares out, inadvertently or for interest income. These share loans may be used to short the stock. This shorting deflates stock price, contradicting the shareholder's initial want. Remember, when things don't make sense, follow the money.

&amp;#x200B;

Share lending occurs SO MIDDLEMEN CAN TAKE PART OF WHAT YOU HAVE AS PROFIT. Now, some good news... You can help stop this. How? First, email your Representative or Senator. Second and more important, call your stock broker. Have them TURN OFF share lending for your account (some brokerages allow for this to be done online).

$BCTX has potential to run 1000-10000%! It's currently a ""micro-cap"" but it DESERVES to be a large cap stock worth MINIMUM 1 bil marketcap. It's only a matter of WHEN not IF. It's a cancer treatment company specifically focused on breast cancer currently and shorts are trying hard to take it down. F#\*K CANCER AND F#\*K the shorts who have no human decency for trying to take down a company curing cancer. PT $100-300

**DD:**

* Recent trials showed INCREDIBLE results, 100% elimination in a breast cancer patients ""eye bulging"" tumour, this patient previously underwent 11 different treatments with no results!
* Recent trails show 2-3x survival rate compared to other breast cancer treatments!
* Amazing phase 2 data, already developed proof of concept, and positive results.
* HIGHLY experienced team, the CEO Dr. William Williams has already successfully taken 11 drugs to the market
* Partnerships with Merck (183bil marketcap) and Incyte (18bil marketcap) are imminent, CEO has ties
* Long term they've stated they will use extra cash for creating a ""mega biotech"" and moving on to cure other cancers other than breast cancer
* Recently hired 3 PR companies, going to be rolling out tons of positive PR soon
* Only hit the nasdaq 3 months ago, which is why its so undervalued as it has not been found yet!

**Valuation:**

* Currently sitting at 50 million market cap, similar competitors in cancer space and trial timeline sitting a 200mil-1bil (4-20x alone if we hit those market caps)
* 55 million cash on hand (more cash on hand than its market cap)
* Recent offerings mean no more dilution to come anytime soon
* Private investor just put 27 million into this stock, and private investors are known to only invest in companies that have massive upside (100-1000%)
* Many institutions have bought in, over 60% of the float is LOCKED and held by whales including the CEO who bought a ton of his own company stock (very bullish)
* VERY low float, if we got even half the volume of AMC, it can send this 1000-10,000% and KILL the shorts (float comparable to $GLSI)
* currently sitting at rank #1 short squeeze ranking on FINTEL

tl;dr: This stock will be sitting in the triple digits within a year, with or without this squeeze. However, I hate seeing shorts trying to destroy a company that is changing lives and curing cancer.

So yeah, today was wild.

But based on the Ortex data below and today's price action, it feels like shorts CudReallybFuk and this was just the begining.

If we see a bunch of buying in the pre-market and the ticker gaps up at the open, we're almost assuredly gonna be destroying a few more shorts and forcing them to cover.

And that's gotta be fucking terrifying to them, because they know if they can't drive the price back down between now and June 17th, this thing could go parabolic. Why? Because they know we already had multiple catalysts coming down the pike that were expected to pop the stock price to some extent.

I mean, this timing is almost perfect üëÄ

1. On the 17th Canoo has Investor Day where they're going to show off and demo the bangbus, ChadTruk and TacoTruk in person for the first time and on a live-stream, and then
2.

And now a prayer ...

Dear tendie gods, if you're listening, we ask that you protect and show favor to the brave WSB warriors who are battling on the front-lines against these evil fucking shorts. We ask that you vanquish the demons who've been betting against Canoo and all the other meme-stocks by forcing them to cover the hundreds of millions of shares they've used to artificially depress the stock prices of our beloved companies, thus raining the billions they once held, down upon our entire primate family. And all powerful tendie god, if you grant us victory in this campaign, we vow to enthusiastically share our spoils with various luxury car dealerships, island resorts and yacht rental services around the world. Thank you for the time and consideration. In your name we pray. Amen üôèüèº

&amp;#x200B;

Since my last post, we have seen good signs for Tilray- consistently green days. I have been tracking the technical indicators and it appears longs are heavily favored for a trade in the short term. See the technicals below:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g8whk7h8t4471.png?width=1384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a42992564dc578d79f67261fa2a343ef330e10b

&amp;#x200B;

This is a daily technical analysis which favors 9 bullish technical indicators to 1 bearish indicator.

In addition, you can see 11:1 favorability on the daily moving averages.

&amp;#x200B;

Things get interesting because the volume is gradually increasing with the combination of the share price increasing.

&amp;#x200B;

Using Fibonacci retracement + other technical indicators I believe a break of  23.49 resistance could lead to a big daily rally.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Comparatively, we saw some big rallies in popular reddit names today- specifically CLOV.

[CLOV had a SI ratio of 0.99 before the takeoff + a short volume ratio of 0.5 a day before the big move](https://preview.redd.it/e19ashksu4471.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9903821f22c8cf3e3cf28d48aad3b959fed3d13)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[TLRY currently has an SI ratio of 1.86 and short vol ratios ranging from 0.15-0.55](https://preview.redd.it/1kk7h8e0v4471.png?width=1340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6e10f931e13e4a1fe187b87965494d041496810)

&amp;#x200B;

TLRYs SI is moderately higher than CLOV- the share price keeps increasing in addition to volume. The question really is, how long can TLRY stay green and maintain momentum? At this point it's not a matter of if shorts cover, but WHEN will shorts cover? This high short interest is unjustified as Tilray has announced very bullish fundamental news including: new product line, recent reverse merger with Aphria, and strong regulatory statements on medical cannabis. My price target for the short term is: $120.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the key here is consistent volume + eating up the ask for a big win for WSB. All my buddies out there who bought at 70, we are coming back for you! :)

Welcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes ü¶ç. We collectively are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon-eating apes who are eager to eat some tasty bananas üçå. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions üí¨ in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.

**The main topic and example today is $CLOV.** You've most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four-leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tenders (currency).

$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I'm wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They 'borrow' the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here's the catch. If they 'borrow' the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?

**Good. Now, what causes the short squeeze?** Truth is many factors. WSB as a whole usually rally around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and in turn, causes the stock to go up.

**What is the perfect recipe?** Well, because it's so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they've bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four-leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will 'exercise' their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the 'strike' price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once.)

**Is it too late to purchase $CLOV?** No, it's not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those bananas back to us at a higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isn't as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually are a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don't worry. You'll profit if you hold. What you're seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan.

**What will the price hit? When do I sell?** Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem. The stonk market is a scary place. There is always a risk, but this risk, for now, is limited.

**Did I miss out? Should I buy it now?** It's up to you, I'm not s financial advisor. Personally, I'm doubling down tomorrow at open, no matter the price. So do what you must with that information.

To all of those stuck on AMC and GME. This is not for you. This is also not a distraction from either of those. Feel free to go with your gut. What I'm telling you, is there is tons of opportunity here, and there will be enough tendies for everyone.

Apes, stay calm, follow the drill. I wish every single one of you, the best of luck. üçÄ After all, we have the $CLOVer on our side. üëç

AMA üó£Ô∏è

Edit: On June 18th many options contracts expire. So expect tons of movement in the coming days in an upward trend. Expect price drops a day or two before June 18th as paper hands try and exit. Don't fret, it will go back up. üé¢ Also, NO SHORTS HAVE COVERED THEIR POSITIONS YET. This means this hasn't even begun yet. The next few days will be interesting.

Edit June 9th, 2021: Some may be very worried about the price dropping a tiny bit. This is something that happens with stocks. I call these types of fluctuations routine. I personally will continue to hold as it's clear that these fluctuations are perfectly natural and healthy. For me, there is absolutely no reason to sell or even worry.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.
5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.
8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.
9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:
10. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.
11. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter &amp; Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.
12. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.
13. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.
14. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.
15. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
16. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.
17. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.
18. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen &amp; Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.
19. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
20. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.
21. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.
2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

I‚Äôm a SaaS business owner and have casually made video games since high school and I‚Äôm a bit retarded about stocks but I am buying $U because I think they can go to the moon if they play their cards right.

None of this is financial advice or based on unity news reports; it‚Äôs based on what I‚Äôve watched other platform companies do with strategic M&amp;A and unity‚Äôs unique position to pursue a massive niche based on their tech and tech they are in a unique position to acquire. I eat crayons and have a TBI.

Basic facts: Unity makes a game development platform that makes it cheap and easy to quickly build quality games. Most of their revenue comes from licenses and the content in their asset store and they tend to make money whether or not people even play your game. Some of their revenue also comes from providing operator solutions which basically means helping you keep your game up and running.

#Big play #1: get paid whenever a game is played

There are third party tools emerging on their platform that let you host server hosted multiplayer games and pay based on how many concurrent users you have. Unity could strategically acquire these types of services and bake them into the platform. **This effectively transforms them from a service that gets paid when you make a game to one that gets paid every time it‚Äôs played... even if you‚Äôre playing for free.** An example of this is Photon Unity Network

#Big play #2: the Netflix of gaming

What‚Äôs the number one thing gamers hate? Payment decisions. They hate microtransactions and as much as they won‚Äôt admit it they hate paying full price for AAA games just as much as they hate microtransactions. **Someone is going to go after the Netflix model. Unity is best positioned to do this.**

Why is unity the best positioned to do this? Because they have a massive amount of assets in their store to crank out a crazy amount of copycat games. They can also be a platform for creators like YouTube is and pay out creators based on play time. They can even go as far as making the games free to develop cause you‚Äôre gonna put it on their subscription platform.

Steam can‚Äôt do this because think they have their hooks in the development process enough to make this convenient for developers and it seems to directly conflict with their existing pricing model instead of working in conjunction with it.

I could go on but my phone is getting really slow and the line at Wendy‚Äôs is getting long with people demanding tendies and claiming they own the place.

tl;dr microtransactions in gaming can be killed off with a Subscription model that only unity can pull off. I have no idea if they have even are thinking about pursuing this.

* Hostess was taken public after filing and emerging for bankruptcy in 2012. Since then it has has strong revenue growth over the past 20 quarters
* The company is now highly profitable and it has weathered the pandemic well.  Gross profit in the past 12 months has been $371 Million, up 39% compared to two years ago.
* Hostess is funneling much of its profits into its business for future growth. It is also rapidly growing its [market share in the Sweet Baked Goods category](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/e20aeeb6-2880-4278-a362-f222573d81f6)
* The company is in the process of reinventing itself and the products it offers. They have announced plans and capital expenditures to break into the morning convenience food market.
* They have also recently expanded their leadership team and appointed [this absolute stud](https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2021/05/28/hostess-chief-growth-officer-dan-oleary.html) as their new Chief Growth Officer.
* Altogether this puts TWNK is in the much-coveted position of being both a value (think Warren buffett) and growth (thing Bill hwang) type stock. At the moment, there is no dividend as the company is reinvesting cash into its business for future growth, but there are plans for future stock buybacks in 2022 and beyond.
* ANALysts love the stock. The consensus from analysts is Very Bullish (out of the 11 analysts that have covered the stock, 2 TWNK is a strong buy, 6 say its a buy, and 3 say its a hold.

*Now let‚Äôs talk shorts*

* Short interest is 20.77% of the float  That‚Äôs higher than most meme tickers here (comparable to AMC GME, much higher than BB, WEN, etc). Furthermore, short interest has [increased 44%](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TWNK/short-interest/) since the start of January are we‚Äôre starting to see a number of pops this spring from [failed to deliver shares](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=TWNK).
* The stock has very low volume right now (only an average of 1.2M shares traded per day). If a squeeze were to happen, at the current volume it would take shorts a month to cover.
* Additionally, 123.67% of all the float is held by institutions, and very little by retail meaning that any significant volume will send the stock flying.
* If TWNK turns into a crusade against shorty, I could see us squeezing to $69. *Right the stock is only at a 2B market cap so there‚Äôs plenty of room to grow*

That‚Äôs about it thank you for reading to the end. Despite the meme potential and parallels to GME, this stock has surprisingly flown under this sub‚Äôs radar so far . There were a few posts back in January (see [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahib2/twinkies_for_tendies_long_thesis_on_hostess/)  for more extensive DD) that didn‚Äôt catch on, but with it being meme season and Pride month üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà, I could see $TWNK possibly flying past the moon and straight into Uranus üçëü™ê

WTI oil is now $70 per barrel. Last time that happened, CPE was valued at $176 per share (currently $49 per share). One key difference since then, is that CPE is twice as large with an acquisition, meaning it will bring in vastly greater revenue than before.

America has limited oil production due to democratic policy. The world has been unable to survey for new oil due to covid lockdown. Now that the pandemic is coming to a close, we are quickly depleting the small oil reserved we have left, and we are severely backlogged in the effort to produce more.

Furthermore, this company is extremely well run. They doubled in size with an acquisition, and had a fantastic outlook pre-pandemic. With Oil at record highs, this company is primed to perform.

As we may know, no solution can monopolize the clean transition. Very likely, BEVs will dominate light duty, while hybrids, biofuels, Renewable Natural Gas will gain market share in Heavy Duty trucks. Hydrogen will play a role when its green supply is secured.

You have to look at legislative developments of this Act: Clean Energy for America Act. if this is passed, future will be bright for clean transportation

&amp;#x200B;

here the parts that may interest RNG and consequently $CLNE

 it is a copy paste from the link:

* ***Clean Fuel Production Credit.*** *A new credit would be available for ‚Äútransportation fuel‚Äù (defined as fuel suitable for use as a fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft) that is produced after December 31, 2022. The amount of the credit would vary depending on the lifecycle carbon emissions of the given fuel. Generally, for transportation fuel sold before January 1, 2030, the credit would equal the product of (1) $1.00 per gallon of transportation fuel produced and sold by the taxpayer (as adjusted for inflation) and (2) the emissions factor for such fuel (that is, an amount equal to the quotient of (A) an amount equal to the baseline emissions rate, minus the emissions rate for such fuel, divided by (B) the baseline emissions rate). To qualify for the credit, the transportation fuel must be produced at a qualified facility and sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person (1) for use by such person in the production of a fuel mixture, (2) for use by such person in a trade or business, or (3) who sells such fuel at retail into the fuel tank of another person. The credit would be subject to phase-out if the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation of persons and goods annually in the United States are determined to be equal to or less than 25 percent of the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation of persons and goods in the United States for calendar year 2021.*
* ***Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit****. Section 30C(a) provides a credit of 30 percent of the cost of any qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year, subject to a credit cap. The key changes in the bill would be to increase the Section 30C credit cap from $30,000 to $200,000, in the case of qualified property that is depreciable property, and to expand the definition of qualifying fuels to consist of hydrogen and any transportation fuel for which the Clean Fuel Production Credit is allowed. (I think this is about new rng fueling stations).*

Its following what appears to be the exact same set up as last time. Small spiratic gains, then shorted heavily. Then its rinse and repeat until the shorts start losing ground. The last time the bears were this out of ammo was the last GME and AMC skyrocketed end if February. 

I'm getting deja vu. 

This stock has hit its tipping point today in my opinion by breaking through the 21 dollar wall. It appears that the shorts covered then reapplied at 21.20 which we just broke through again. This was exactly what was happening from what I can tell last time she gamma squeezed. 

Now with multiple stocks skyrocketing all in the same week, the hedge funds holding this down are extremely weak. RKT has been gaining volume the last week. RKT is a powder keg about to go off! The one major difference between this stock and the ""MEMES"" Is that ROCKET makes money, a shit ton of money.  

Now I understand that we dont have the dividend news we had last time. I get that. But I think with the continuing pressure we still see another massive spike in RKTS future!

Estimated was .46 and actual was 1.09 Their revenue increased as well. Their net sales increased 18% over last year. They have a market cap of 2.63 B and trade at a P/E of 7.66 as compared to Dick's which trades at a P/E of 13.85. As you can see this stock is criminally undervalued as compared to its peers. IPO lockup period ended on 3/31 which caused a negative dip on open that day but the stock finished positive on the day as there was not a mass sell off as shortens of the stock had hoped for.

The stock has been shorted from the start because I believe it was just lumped into the typical brick &amp; mortar category and will just assumed would bleed out due to online shopping. This was a grave miscalculation as ASO provides a niche variety of products that the online space is not fulfilling adequately &amp; their top competitor Dicks has been backing out of like guns and ammo. They have a current short interest of 22.5% with a public float of 55M. The stock currently is at a all time high of around $40, that means every single hedge fund that shorted this stock is negative now. With some more volume and upward pressure in this stock and we could see a squeeze similar to the one that happened with RKT. I don't see this stock tripling or anything of the scale that GME had but I do see a substantial price increase soon if the right factors materialize.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock that is currently trading at a ATH with high short interest which makes it prime for a squeeze.

Positions: (9) 7/16 30 strike calls

The goal is to buy 100 shares of company ABC and sell covered calls to make passive income on a weekly basis. However, company ABC's stock price is too high and you can't afford 100 shares. You also don't want to risk the premium required when buying a deep ITM call, so instead you take the other side of that trade. If you sell a deep ITM call with a 3 month expiration date and the use that premium you earned to purchase 100 shares of company ABC, then you can now sell covered calls. **Can someone please explain to me why I'm retarded?**

Here are the scenarios I see happening: (I think this strategy would be best with a stock with moderate volatility and trading sideways or down.)

1. Weekly call option expires worthless, you keep premium. Sell another covered call. Rinse and repeat.
2. You're assigned on your weekly call option. You sell 100 shares at the strike price. Depending on how high the price goes, you can no longer afford 100 shares until it drops and risk significant loss if 3-month call is assigned.
   1. This risk can be mitigated if covered call premium is immediately reinvested. Every week you'll have a growing cushion of shares. For example, if stock ABC is currently $600 and you sold a covered call at $605 for $2000 premium. The reinvested 2k can increase your shares from 100 to 103. If the stock price ends the week at $630, your $605 call is assigned and you can buy 96 shares + 3 remaining = 99 shares. You're still short 1 share, so that's a risk that must be managed. But if you've been doing this for a few weeks, you'd probably have more than 3 shares on reserve.
3. 3-month call is assigned. You sell 100 shares at strike price of $1. You haven't lost any money, you simply returned the cash borrowed for the strategy and keep what you've made from covered calls; however, you now need to close out of your current covered call, which is now a naked call.
   1. Selling your reserve stocks would allow you to raise the funds needed to close out of your position. Of course, this depends on what day of the week your 3-month call is assigned. The closer to friday, the less likely you can close out and risk losing 60.5k you don't have.
   2. Another option would be to sell a new 3-month deep ITM call (or a call greater than 3 months) and immediately buy 100 shares again.
