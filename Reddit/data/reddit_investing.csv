## Modeling Assset Prices

**Risk premium** is the compensation one receives for taking on additional risk, in the form of expected excess return compared to the risk-free rate of return.  The risk-free rate of return would be something like the yield of US treasury bills.  ELI5: If you invest in something dangerous, you want to be paid more.

When it comes to equities, there is a concept called the efficient market hypothesis, which states that asset prices reflect all available information.  The most effective way to verify this is to develop an asset pricing model which is sufficiently accurate based on given inputs.  You may have heard of **CAPM** (Capital Asset Pricing Model, Sharpe-1964 and Lintner-1965) – which is one of the first major accepted models whose main input is β.  You’ve probably heard of α and β, but essentially α is the ability to beat the market, and β is the volatility (specifically the sensitivity market conditions).  As an investor, your goal is generally to get as much α as possible, without taking on more risk than you can tolerate.

CAPM does a decent job of explaining **Market** risk premium as a function β – which is effectively the benefit you get from investing in stocks rather than bonds.  However, it was found to capture only about 70% of the excess return, so either the market isn’t efficient, or there were other undiscovered factors.  Enter the discovery of the **Value** and **Size** factors.  Researchers discovered that value stocks (ones that had high book value relative to price) and small cap stocks (ones that had smaller total valuation) tended to outperform the market in a way that wasn’t explained by CAPM.  So Fama and French (1992) developed a new **3-Factor Model** incorporating Market, Value, and Size premiums.  This now explained about 90% of asset pricing.

More recently (2015), Fama and French have since updated to a 5-Factor Model, which includes the **Profitability** and **Investment** factors that could explain about 95%  of asset pricing.  Profitability is rather self-explanatory, while Investment refers to conservative vs. aggressive asset growth (with conservative outperforming).  One interesting finding was that the Value premium could actually be omitted without hurting the model accuracy because the Value premium could be absorbed by the Profitability and Investment premiums.  So from here on, I’ll use a **4-Factor** model of: Market, Size, Profitability, Investment.

## Quantifying Risk Premia

So why should you care, as an investor?  One major debate in investing is active vs. passive, with most evidence indicating that active management in aggregate fails to deliver excess return after accounting for fees.  This is why most people are recommended to simply use low cost, market-cap weighted index funds such as $VOO or $VT for the majority of their portfolio.  However, for more *risk-tolerant* investors, this may not be the best possible result.  If there are indeed ways to capture *independent risk* beyond the Market premium, then it is possible to increase expected return while still remaining passive and diversified.

Let’s look at data from the Ken French Data Library, over the period 1963-2020.  We examine the overall risk premiums generated by Market, Profitability, Investment, and Size factors.  We also examine the *probability of a positive risk premium existing over a 10-year period*.   The assumption here is that if you are risk-tolerant, you are probably younger and looking at long timescales.  The premiums can vary widely or be negative for individual years, so we are hoping to buy and hold, harvesting a positive premium over many years.  If you are middle-aged, you might be better off sticking to the basic market-cap weighted approach as it is lower risk.

Aggregating this data, let’s further account for geographical effects.  Since the premiums vary between different market regions, we’ll use a crude 60-20-20 respective weightings for USA, developed, and emerging markets.  Obviously this is not a perfect weighting but it’s good enough to illustrate the broader trend.  The resulting premium is measured in additional % annualized excess return compared to the risk-free return.  The result is as follows:

[4 Factor Risk Premiums, 1963-2020]( https://imgur.com/a/pXH7eOc)

This is a surprisingly intuitive result.  As the value of each factor premium increases, the reliability of that premium decreases.  This chart increases confidence in the efficient market hypothesis, and provides a rough guideline for the cost of each premium.  If you only want a slight boost to expected return, you can increase weight in small cap stocks.  If you want a more sizeable boost with more risk of downside, you can increase weight in profitable stocks.

**Disclaimer:** at the end of the day, it is always dubious to predict future returns even based on long historical periods like this one.  You also need to be able to stomach long periods where the premium may not exist, such as the poor performance of value stocks this past decade.  However, for disciplined investors with a long horizon – capturing these factors has a good chance of generating real excess returns.

So, what to actually invest in?  These days, there are more and more ETFs out there that incorporate factor-based investing.  However, it’s difficult to get exposure to the right factors and across all market regions.  I’ve compiled a table of some options here:



* | Market | Profitability | Investment | Size | Multifactor
---|---|----|----|----|----
US | VTI, SCHB, ITOT | QUAL |  | VB, IJR | LRGF
Developed | VEA | IQLT |  | SCZ | INTF
Emerging | VWO |  |  | EEMS | EMGF
**Global** | **VT** |  |  |  | **ACWF**


There are quite a few gaps, if you know any options to fill those feel free to comment and I can edit them in.  There are also other non-fundamental factors such as Value and Momentum that have numerous options.  How to weight them is another issue beyond the scope of this post, and depends again on your risk tolerance.

*  Bitcoin can be used to generate the alpha that financial industry is looking for years to come. 
*  Bitcoin can capture the current gold market cap and reach $10T of capitalization. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The current economic setup might end up far from the price stability and the occupation central banks wish to reach, but either in a risk of inflation or disinflation.

As a consequence of COVID pandemic, fiscal and monetary policies flooded a huge amount of liquidity in the economic systems all around the world. In the USA the total amount made available in response to COVID-19 is $4.5 Trillion, whereas federal funds rate were lowered, discount window lending costs were lowered, purchase of treasury and agency securities increased and repo operations have been expanded. And these are only a part of the operations put in place by FED. In Europe the response was €2.3 Trillion whereas ECB put in place €1.8 Trillion of operations. In the USA, for instance, such an amount of intervention has been seen during WWII where the expansion of GDP was followed by spikes in inflation rates of 10% and even more.

High inflation rates hurt mainly fixed incomes. The first markets to be hit in this case are bond markets both treasury and corporate because of less attractiveness of fixed incomes during inflation times. The lack of demand in the treasury market for high expected inflation pushes yield rates up resulting also for correction in stock market. Discount factors that use yield curve to discount future corporate earnings weight more and consequently resulting in minor firm intrinsic values. This concept is exacerbated in particular for growth stocks but it is well known that during inflation periods stock market in general does poorly.

Instruments to hedge against inflation are considered to be: TIPS, REITs in some measure, and gold even though the hedging power of the precious metal is controversial. But while TIPS are taxable, REITs can hinder returns, and gold is very inefficient with its insurance and deposit costs, Bitcon can play the major role here as an alternative instrument to store value and a way of seeking alpha.

Although central banks argue that they can monitor inflation and taper their ease policies, it can conversely cause concerns of deflation given a strong rebound in the economy followed by a reduction of monetary supply. Global real GDP growth will jump from 3% of the 2019 to 6% of the 2021, and then it is forecasted to be at 4.4% in 2021, still above the 3% level of 2019.

Deflation is generally considered to have a negative impact on stocks since lower prices tend to hurt corporate net income. Also, it can encourage consumers to save money and reduce spending, negatively impacting revenues, and eroding shareholder value. Regarding the bond market, it can have a positive impact on some of them. Government debt is worth more because fixed payments become increasingly more valuable. Interest rates tend to decrease during a deflationary period, which leads to increases in bond prices and profits for bondholders. Deflation isn't necessarily positive for corporate bonds, especially those in companies that are not value stocks. Deflation makes debt payments more difficult each year since they become more expensive. This puts companies at risk because they eventually will be unable to pay their debts.

In this case, instruments to hedge against deflation are considered to be: investment-grade bonds, very defensive value stocks and cash. But while a rush to buy investment-grade bonds can erode returns, very defensive value stocks can be riskier right now given the high multiples that cause anxiety in investors and doubt about the amount of future returns, and cash that cannot generate as much alpha in money market as in stocks or bonds, Bitcoin once again can absolve to the need of returns.

Therefore, the fact that Bitcoin does not have a specific link to any underlying such as earnings or interest rates can turn out being a pro. It might acquire the status of asset to preserve alpha when economic conditions hit conventional financial markets. In fact, the current economic setup has the potential to spotlight Bitcoin as an alpha generation asset under uncertainty. Clearly Bitcoin brings other different pros that can speed up this function and at the same time different cons that can slow it down.

Among the pros: 1. Bitcoin is dominant in comparison with gold in terms of return-volatility. On the period that goes from 2014 to 2021, Bitcoin shows greater average daily returns and a smaller volatility; 2. Bitcoin is already used to offset capital gains from ahter asset classes selling it in a loss during corrections and buying it an instant later without the traditional provision in stock market, for example, where the loss can lower taxation only if the asset was bought 30 days before the sell and not re-bought before 30 days after the sell; 3. Bitcoin can be used to keep the electric grid in equilibrium acting on demand side makìng it more flexible. Mining can help the massive introduction of renewable resources such as solar and wind energy. The massive introduction of these technologies has showed, in an increasing numerous cases, that it can create conditions where energy markets are pushed toward negative prices resulting in a switching off of renewables themself in favour of conventional energy plants whose costs of switching off and switching on are greater than selling energy at negative prices. in other words, mining during excess of energy supply can increase demand avoiding the formation of negative prices. Moreover, in conjunction with renewable energy providers, miners can forecast when the grid might be in surplus of energy and increase operations profiting not only from mining but also from the incentives coming from transmission system operators.

Among the cons: 1. Competition with other cryptos and offical digital currencies; 2. Ban to trading or mining; 3. Strengthening of crypyo market regulation and taxation; 4. Economy does not enter neigher in inflation nor in deflation, but it slowly goes with disinflation toward long term target.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the Bitcoin market cap forecasted by Cathie Wood seems to be plausible if Bitcon replaces gold. The current gold cap is around $12T. If Bitcoin is capable of attracting most of the speculative transactions on gold, with 19 million of digital coin already in the market, it can easily reach $500K."|investing|Bitcoin: A Way To Hedge The “Alpha” From Future Economic Shocks|1.0|0.6

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/deutsche-bank-warns-of-global-time-bomb-coming-due-to-rising-inflation.html

Inflation may look like a problem that will go away, but is more likely to persist and lead to a crisis in the years ahead, according to a warning from Deutsche Bank economists.

In a forecast that is well outside the consensus from policymakers and Wall Street, Deutsche issued a dire warning that focusing on stimulus while dismissing inflation fears will prove to be a mistake if not in the near term then in 2023 and beyond.

The analysis especially points the finger at the Federal Reserve and its new framework in which it will tolerate higher inflation for the sake of a full and inclusive recovery. The firm contends that the Fed’s intention not to tighten policy until inflation shows a sustained rise will have dire impacts.

“The consequence of delay will be greater disruption of economic and financial activity than would be otherwise be the case when the Fed does finally act,” Deutsche’s chief economist, David Folkerts-Landau, and others wrote. “In turn, this could create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world, particularly in emerging markets.”

As part of its approach to inflation, the Fed won’t raise interest rates or curtail its asset purchase program until it sees “substantial further progress” toward its inclusive goals. Multiple central bank officials have said they are not near those objectives.

In the meantime, indicators such as the consumer price and personal consumption expenditures price indices are well above the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Policymakers say the current rise in inflation is temporary and will abate once supply disruptions and base effects from the early months of the coronavirus pandemic crisis wear off.

The Deutsche team disagrees, saying that aggressive stimulus and fundamental economic changes will present inflation ahead that the Fed will be ill-prepared to address.

“It may take a year longer until 2023 but inflation will re-emerge. And while it is admirable that this
patience is due to the fact that the Fed’s priorities are shifting towards social goals, neglecting inflation leaves global economies sitting on a time bomb,” Folkerts-Landau said. “The effects could be devastating, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.”

Most on the Street see tame inflation
To be sure, the Deutsche position is not widely held by economists.

Most on Wall Street agree with the Fed’s view that current inflation pressures are transitory, and they doubt there will be any policy changes soon.

Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said there are “strong reasons” to support the position. One he cites is the likelihood that the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits will send workers back to their jobs in the coming months, easing wage pressures.

On price pressures in general, Hatzius said that much of current spike is being driven by “the unprecedented role of outliers” that will ebb and bring levels back closer to normal.

“All this suggests that Fed officials can stick with their plan to exit only very gradually from the easy current policy stance,” Hatzius wrote.

That will be a mistake, according to the Deutsche view.

Congress has approved more than $5 trillion in pandemic-related stimulus so far, and the Fed has nearly doubled its balance sheet, through monthly asset purchases, to just shy of $8 trillion. The stimulus continues to come through even with an economy that is expected to grow at about a 10% pace in the second quarter and an employment picture that has added an average 478,000 jobs a month in 2021.

“Never before have we seen such coordinated expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. This will continue as output moves above potential,” Folkers-Landau said. “This is why this time is different for inflation.”

The Deutsche team said the coming inflation could resemble the 1970s experience, a decade during which inflation averaged nearly 7% and was well into double digits at various times. Soaring food and energy prices along with the end of price controls helped push that era’s soaring inflation.

Then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker led the effort to squash inflation then, but needed to use dramatic interest rate hikes that triggered a recession. The Deutsche team worries that such a scenario could play out again.

“Already, many sources of rising prices are filtering through into the US economy. Even if they are transitory on paper, they may feed into expectations just as they did in the 1970s,” they said. “The risk then, is that even if they are only embedded for a few months they may be difficult to contain, especially with stimulus so high.”

The firm said interest rate hikes could “cause havoc in a debt-heavy world,” with financial crises likely particularly in emerging economies where growth won’t be able to overcome higher financing costs."|investing|Deutsche Bank warns of global ‘time bomb’ coming due to rising inflation|153.0|0.93

There's so much to this 75-page paper that it's honestly hard to generate a full hypothesis on what this means for the future, as much is concluded within the paper itself which I have only started reading myself. Regardless, I agree firmly with the final conclusions drawn in the blog post regarding the asset class returns. Specific takeaways well worth as a reminder if nothing else:

&gt;Short-term returns for the stock market can be highly unpredictable and unstable. Long-term returns for the stock market have been far more stable. While real returns have been elevated for the past 5 and 10 years, there isn’t much of a difference between returns over 15, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150 or 200 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is comforting even if future returns are promised to no one.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s also a good reminder that the high returns in the current cycle won’t last forever. You can’t set your iPhone to it but eventually higher than average returns will be followed by lower than average returns...  
&gt;  
&gt;...While gross returns will likely be lower, net returns should be higher for those who are able to avoid behavioral mistakes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The biggest threat to long-term returns is your behavior in the short-term

Page 43 goes into large-cap stocks moreso, stating in part...

&gt; ...Due to their size and power, the large growth stocks are attracting the glare of politicians and regulators across the globe. Pressure is building for a digital tax and/ or a break up to dilute their market share. In particular, a globally coordinated effort is under way, led by the OECD. It plans to reset the global corporate tax system such that companies will have to pay based on where they have activities, and minimum tax rates will apply. In effect, this will cut the incentive for companies to base their headquarters in low-tax jurisdictions. The US, however, is opposed to such a digital tax, which would have a big effect on US companies. With global tax forces pushing in one direction and the US opposing them, yet acting on competition concerns, the stage looks set for a reckoning for mega-cap growth stocks. Given their ubiquity throughout the fabric of life around the world, it seems likely that a sudden bout of disorder could shake not only companies and stock markets but also how we live our lives.

VOO returned 14.54% annualized return since 2011.

From $10,000 to $41,163. With about \~$100 in expenses (0.03% expense ratio)

VOOBreakdown returned 15.49% annualized return since 2011.

From $10,000 to 44,836. With aobut \~$400 in expenses (avg. 0.1% expense ratio across all 11 sector etfs)

The difference is small, but VOOBreakdown has higher returns with more diversity (Sharpe ratio 1.07 compared to 1.04 of VOO).

\------------------------------------------------

Looking back I was wrong and forget an important detail. When accounting for rebalancing, the difference in returns is minimized. The more often you rebalance VOOBreakdown, the less returns you'll see. When you don't rebalance, I believe the larger allocation of tech stocks carry some of the returns later on, but the aim of VOOBreakdown is to beat VOO only using broken-down etfs for more diversity, but it seems that is redundant with no difference in returns.

According to Investopedia, ""An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange, just like a stock.""

So an ETF is a basket of securities - therefore a simple explanation could be that the ETF price is just the average of all securities it tracks. 

So we know how a stocks price move up and down - It's a function of the supply and demand on that stock. How much someone is willing to pay for a share. The more people who want shares and are willing to pay ever increasing prices from the sellers will drive the price of the stock upward and vice versa.  

But there is more to it isn't there. Options play a very important role in the price fluctuations of a stock. If there are significant Puts and Calls against a stock then the Market Maker (MM) has to buy and sell shares to become Delta neutral. As this occurs, large purchases or sell offs can occur, which would push the stock price around. 

How does any of this work with ETFs?

As I stated at the top, an ETF is only an average of the sum of its parts therefor none of this price action is supposed to work right? SO I ask you all who are much smarter than me - How does an ETF's price work? Since supply &amp; demand still apply to an ETF. You can still watch ETFs on Level 2 and see the price rise and fall with the orders executed.

And since MMs still have to hedge options on ETFs, how does it affect the price of something that is only an average of something else? Furthermore, if an ETF's price can rise independently of the movement of the securities it tracks, can those movements effect the value of the individual stocks its made up from and if they can be manipulated by the ETF wouldn't that mean that the individual stock inside the ETF is more/less valuable than the stock outside the ETF, essentially giving an individual stock different values (value inside the ETF, value outside the ETF)?

Anyone else think Alibaba fundamental is crazy good for the depressed price?

The only thing it comes down to is political risk (both domestic and foreign). Which is not zero but feels overblown as it's mostly noise.

Interactive brokers talks a good game: they promise 50% to give you of the interest collected, and they advertise very high borrowing rates. In my case, I was looking at RIDE: borrowing rate is currently 47%, but it was 80% when I decided to start my experiment.

I opened an IB account, and enabled SYE. I also enrolled in Fidelity's ""fully paid lending"" program. Fidelity consistently reports lower borrowing rates than IB, so I was expecting IB to be a better deal for me. Here's the outcome:

Fidelity currently gives me 17% interest on my RIDE shares. IB gives me only 10%. For some reason, IB collects only 20% interest (of which I get half), even though they list the borrowing rate as 47%. I'll be moving back to Fidelity.

EDIT: to clarify a little further, this only makes sense if you own highly shorted stocks that yield high interest rates. I own RIDE and UWMC, which to me look like low risk, high return investments courtesy of the shorts. I totally agree that shorts can keep them down for as long as they want, but  if I get 17%/year while they're doing it (plus any cap gains), I'm not going to complain.

While I hope that my post below is helpful and you maybe learn something, I'd love to get your feedback and ideas of how you think about each factor so we can create a more robust framework with which to use this approach. This post was getting quite long so I’ll post it in a few parts over the next few days.

## What is the Risk Factor Summation Method?

Originally developed by Ohia TechAngels, the RFS is a method used by venture capitalists and angel investors to value pre-revenue companies, typically in the pre-seed or pre-Series A stage of funding. It builds on approaches such as the [Venture Capital Valuation method](https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/equity-valuation/venture-capital-valuation-method/) or the [Dave Berkus Valuation Method](https://berkonomics.com/?p=2752) by considering a broader range of risk factors that can affect start-ups as they grow into mature businesses.

Ohio TechAngels reportedly described the method as follows:

&gt;Reflecting the premise that the higher the number of risk factors, then the higher the overall risk, this method forces investors to think about the various types of risks which a particular venture must manage in order to achieve a lucrative exit. Of course, the largest is always ‘management risk’ which demands the most consideration and investors feel is the most overarching risk in any venture. While this method certainly considers the level of management risk it also prompts the user to assess other risk types” including: management, stage of the business, legislation/political risk, manufacturing risk, sales and marketing risk, funding/capital raising risk, competition risk, technology risk, litigation risk, international risk, reputation risk, potential lucrative exit.

&gt;!""Reportedly described"" as this is quoted all over the internet but I cannot find an original source.!&lt;

## How does the RFS Method Work?

**Step one**, an initial pre-money value for the company is determined through looking for 'market comparables', typically competitors in the same or similar industries. This shouldn't take into account specifics of the company per se but look for the average valuation for the industry and at the growth stage the company is operating in.

**Step two**, the method considers 12 risk factors, which we will cover in a moment. Each risk is assessed with regards to how it may impact the ability of the company to grow and execute a lucrative exit, and is assigned a score as follows:

* \+2 = Very Positive / Very Low Risk
* \+1 = Positive / Low Risk
* 0 = Neutral / Medium Risk
* \-1 = Negative / High Risk
* \-2 = Very Negative / Very High Risk

**Step three**, The average industry valuation derived in step one is adjusted up or down depending on the score for each risk factor. The adjustment amount can vary depending on what source you ask but typically shifts around $250k for each point move either way (e.g. +2 would add +$500k to the valuation; -1 would subtract $250k).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Thought 1: is a flat adjustment of $250k per point a suitable number? Should we consider otherwise for certain industries, or adjust this up or down based on the stage of the company (angel, seed, early) or the position of the market cycle?*

&amp;#x200B;

## So What Are the Factors?

I'm glad you asked. As mentioned, there are 12 and are presented in roughly the same order wherever you look. [Retiba](https://retiba.com/online-valuation/risk-factors-summation/)\* has offered some great summary sentences to get you started on what each risk means, which are included behind spoiler blocks in case you want to try and guess first - if you get 100% as a newcomer I will be suitably impressed.

\* don't expect to use the tool through that link without first surrendering your email address :-(

&amp;#x200B;

1. Management Risk - &gt;!Is it possible that the current business management team will impose a high risk on the business in the future?!&lt;
2. Stage of the Business - &gt;!Is the business at the initial stage of the maturity cycle that is inherently risky and likely to fail to a great extent?!&lt;
3. Legislation / Political Risk - &gt;!Can unfavourable regulation, legislation, and political conditions lead to business failure?!&lt;
4. Manufacturing Risk, or Service Delivery Risk - &gt;!Is it possible for the business to have trouble producing and failing altogether due to limited raw materials or an inability for counterparties to make good on agreements?!&lt;
5. Sales &amp; Marketing Risk, or ""Go to Market"" Risk - &gt;!How much your business may be affected by sales and marketing problems?!&lt;
6. Funding / Capital Raising Risk - &gt;!Given your awareness of the ecosystem, how likely is it that the business will have trouble raising capital in subsequent rounds?!&lt;
7. Competition Risk - &gt;!Given your awareness of the market, how intense do you assess the competitive environment the business will face?!&lt;
8. Technology Risk - &gt;!To what extent can the emergence of new technologies in the future jeopardize the existence of the business?!&lt;
9. Litigation Risk - &gt;!How likely is it that the business under evaluation goes through litigation crises and fails?!&lt;
10. International Risk - &gt;!To what extent can unfavourable international conditions and interactions with other countries put the business at risk?!&lt;
11. Reputation Risk - &gt;!To what extent can the business under evaluation be exposed to the crisis caused by brand reputation?!&lt;
12. Potential Lucrative Exit - &gt;!How likely it is for the potential lucrative of the business under evaluation to be in trouble in the future, and the company will not be able to make a good profit margin for its products and services?!&lt;

Several of these factors may be quite familiar (e.g. Management Risk, Stage of the Business), while others (e.g. Litigation Risk, International Risk) may be harder to fathom. [Seraf](https://seraf-investor.com/compass/article/approximations-assumptions-and-aspirations-methods-valuing-startups-part-ii) provide a [simple example](https://seraf-investor.com/sites/default/files/Risk%20Factor%20Method-3.jpg) of how positive and negatives for each factor can result in a valuation adjustment. While a helpful indicator, the examples here are limited. I've taken a stab at expanding on each factor and will share these in the next post.

I've been researching lately for a **long term investment**, and while I consider **S&amp;P500 a good option**, I've also came across **Russell1000.**

After reading and looking at the data a bit, the **main takeaways** I get are:

* S&amp;P500 and Russell1000 are **tightly correlated** performance-wise,
* the companies being part of **Russell1000 are picked algorithmically**, instead of by a committee.

Obviously, the S&amp;P500 cos. are chosen according to *certain rules*, but in any case there's *human intervention*. See e.g. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500#Selection_criteria).

First time posting here but I figured this would be a solid place to start to get some feedback on a strategy that I have been using involving about 25% margin and using dividends to pay the interest down. Over the years ive found that when something seems easy, its generally because I’m missing something in the bigger picture which isnt factored into my overall plan so any feedback would be greatly appreciated! This portfolio is founded on higher cap tech heavy stocks leaning towards growth, some value and some less fun index funds, the key component is really focusing it around dividend paying investments…I’ve chosen to omit the actual investments as to not create any bias or general judgement on my holdings. I am simply looking for feedback on this strategy regarding my utilization of margin and how to more effectively use it. So here’s what ive been doing for about the past 6 months. 


I started this portfolio with 10k and have generally been DCA’ing in every week or so and recently I made the decision that on some of my positions the bottom was in and I took about 20 percent margin to buy more. Currently the entire portfolio is worth about 15k and here’s where I am looking for feedback..My plan is just to continue to DCA in as I normally do, pay down a small amount of my margin every month and then when the opportunity arises buy back in using leverage when I feel like a dip presents an opportunity. My margin interest rate is about 6.5% so its not the end of the world and my dividend payout will be used to cover majority of the interest on that anyway. I personally feel that 30% seems to be a safe number however I could be completely wrong. 


I guess my question is, am I utilizing margin effectively or am I making a mistake by paying down margin too quickly where that money could be better utilized by just buying more. What am I missing and/or what are some strategies you use regarding margin for growth heavy stocks? Am I paying my margin down the right way or is it better. Also not looking for “dont use margin”…obviously I am aware of the risks of using margin. 


I know theres a lot that I’m leaving out here with my personal risk tolerance, but I’m just kind of trying to get a feel for the best way to utilize leverage in this weird turbulent market. Another note, I do not wish to exceed 30% margin under any circumstances. This is just a portfolio that I have to learn and develop some skills and not max out margin and try to make as much money as fast as possible.

Hello all,

I am long Regeneron, gave 10 shares @ 497$. Not financial advise. I saw this yesterday and didn't see it discussed, yet.

TLDR: REGENERON received on June 4th the FDA [clearance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-authorizes-lower-1-200-110000685.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW52aXouY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANXXYbaNF8GZL6R6VNc7SFVXmzJXO412QBHXD3v1yXpw-CIsX2AhhbI1FTBY5px_IGMYIh8Pk0SXz8otJFyLmn53RKVUdShJbWzzvebEIeM5LHhV5aEcXMS_RzRN9qqgf91Ojrid7RfQgsv7_hElWuYhfT44Y-uCX_cxSMwFVahB)  to use 1200 mg instead of 2400 mg. it seems this news might boost  income by 13% (assuming that there are little extra cost to implement)  based on the guaranteed US deal until June 30 alone.

I think the timing of this (early June) will impact the stock very positively according to this [article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-authorizes-lower-1-200-110000685.html):

&gt;The  U.S. government will purchase all REGEN-COV doses delivered by June 30,  2021 and may accept additional doses through September 30, 2021 at its  discretion, up to a maximum amount of 1.25 million doses.

Considering  that one former dose is now effectively 2 doses, they will earn double  for basically no extra cost (except packaging and shipping, or maybe  just relabeling the vials, I guess) for doses to be delivered in June.  Depending on how fast this is possible to implement, of course... For  the potential doses until September, I would expect them to have half  the production cost accordingly.

According to this [barron's article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fda-authorizes-lower-regeneron-covid-19-antibody-dose-that-opens-the-door-to-bigger-sales-51622819267?siteid=yhoof2),

&gt;The lower-dose level would allow it to deliver more doses and could increase the amount of the possible payout, [for a total of up to $2.6 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/regeneron-inks-deal-to-sell-covid-19-treatment-to-u-s-even-as-usage-lags-51610545649?mod=article_inline)  
\[...\]  
Regeneron  now says it expects to deliver at least 1 million doses to the  U.S.  government in the second quarter of the year, depending on   manufacturing operations. At the $2,100 per-dose level implied by the   information Regeneron has provided about its contract, the U.S.   government would pay $2.1 billion for those 1 million doses.

More [specifically](https://www.barrons.com/articles/regeneron-inks-deal-to-sell-covid-19-treatment-to-u-s-even-as-usage-lags-51610545649?mod=article_inline)

&gt;Under   the new deal, the government will purchase up to 1.25 million doses   delivered by June 30. Hitting that benchmark would be contingent on   Regeneron being authorized to sell the cocktail at a smaller dosage   level than is currently authorized; at the current dosage level, the   company will deliver 750,000 doses by June 30.  
The  company said  that the government would pay $2.625 billion if all 1.25  million doses  are delivered, implying a price of $2,100 per dose. That  is well over  the implied price of $1,500 per treatment course the  company charged in  its first agreement with the government.

So,  from past delivery estimates of 750 k doses to 1 M doses by June 30  would be additional revenue of 250 k \* 2,100 $ = 525 M $ at presumably  little production cost for Regeneron.  According to [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=REGN), past sales of 9.2 B $ and income of 4 B $ that would be 5.7% increased sales or 13.1% additional income.

That  is not taking the potential 250 k additional doses that the US might  accept between until and Sept 30. And not taking the European [deal](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-secures-55-000-doses-100715709.html) for 55 k doses (if EMA approved) or the Swiss extra 3 k doses into account.

Can someone help me understand what I'm missing.

For example: 

SSO peaked at $82.53 pre covid, it bottomed at $35.74 so you'd be down about 57%

SPY peaked at $337.60 pre covid, it bottomed at $228.80 so you'd be down about 32%

This part makes sense to me, the losses are nearly double with the leveraged ETF however the next part is what I don't understand, it seems to recover just as quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

If you bought SSO at the pre covid peak of $82.53, with the current price of $115.73 you're up about 40%

If you bought SPY at the pre covid peak of $337.60 with the current price of $422.60 you're up about 31%

So despite the far larger drawdown during the covid crash, the SSO has recovered just as fast and is outperforming the SPY.

How is this possible? This is one of the reasons I've read for not buying a leveraged SSO, that if you sit through a drawdown it will take much longer to recover the losses but that doesn't seem to be the case here unless I'm missing something!

Also please note, I understand that the market isn't guaranteed to continue going up and 10 year depressions are possible etc but I'm using a real world example of a drawdown above where despite the far greater initial loss, the leveraged ETF still recovers and outperforms very quickly even if you bought the pre drawdown peak.

Abstract:

Bitcoin users can offer fees to the miners who record transactions on the Blockchain. We document high variation of Bitcoin fees, not only over time, but also within blocks. Further, the blockchain rarely runs at capacity, even though there appears to be excess demand. We argue that this is inconsistent with competitive mining, but is consistent with strategic capacity management. If agents believe that only high fee transactions are executed in a timely fashion then strategic capacity management can be used to increase fee revenue. We note that mining pools facilitate collusion, and estimate that they have extracted least 200 million USD a year in excess fees by making processing artificially capacity scarce."|investing|Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol|151.0|0.85

Not a great report, but not terrible either.

Some key highlights:

• Jobs added 559k vs. 675k estimate 

• Unemployment fell to 5.8%

• Strong hourly earnings 

• Labor participation rate edged lower


In my opinion, the biggest concern here is the drop in the labor participation rate. People are clearly not motivated to come back to work. Been hearing countless stories of small business struggling to hire - ultimately people need to be incentivized to come back. I would expect wages to continue climbing (earnings were up +0.5% MoM) until this gap closes.

Powell is less likely to taper now near-term until further progress is made with closing the labor-market gap.

It's been a couple of days since this made news but Abbvie is being investigated for tax related malpractices.

https://www.thestreet.com/.amp/investing/abbvie-faces-pressure-from-us-senate-over-taxes

Now, I'm not an expert on taxes or related laws, so my understanding on this matter is limited. From what I got, it seems that Abbvie hasn't been caught breaking any tax laws and hence there's only an investigation that has been launched and not a lawsuit. What the investigation will expose remains to be seen.

What this be an appropriate understanding of what's happening?

I am long on Abbvie and bought it when it was in mid-high double digits. So I have a fair bit of profit on this investment. My original strategy was to hold it for another 2 years and depending on whether they come up with an equivalent for Humira, hold it longer.

Can someone shed some light on what can be the worst possible outcome of this investigation? Anything that we should watch out for before it's too late?

1622791936.0|0.0|t3_nrz9xt|38.0|"So I’m going to try to go over what the PSTH pr means as simply as possible, because it’s an extremely complex deal and the market does not like complexity. So, here goes nothing:

1) PSTH and UMG are not one company now.  Rather, PSTH is purchasing UMG shares when they begin trading in Europe, and then giving them to the PSTH shareholders.  They will be worth about $14.75 each. This satisfies the SPAC conditions, and so PSTH does not need to rush to merge with an actual company.  Rather,   each PSTH holder will own 1 share of UMG at $14.75 and 1 share of PSTH at $5.25.  This is just what the shares are “worth” and not what they will actually be trading at.  I cannot tell you what they’ll be trading at because I am not a psychic.

2) PSTH will continue to search for a company to merge with with about $1.5B left in their trust value.  There is no time limit in this because their SPAC conditions were already satisfied.  The deal could happen next week, or in 5 years, only time will tell.

3) Each PSTH shareholder will receive one right to purchase SPARC.  These rights are exercisable at $20.  The rights cannot be exercised until a merger has been completed, and they are gifted to the shareholder, so there is no opportunity cost of holding.  This is important, because as SPARC is not a SPAC, there is not the traditional two year time frame to find a target.

4) For anyone unfamiliar with rights, they are familiar to options.  If SPARC is trading at $30, the right is worth about $30-$20=$10.  Because they cannot be exercised in this scenario until a merger is complete, you are risking no capital by waiting.

SUMMARY:
I may have missed something, so let me know if that is the case, or if anyone has any other questions.  Don’t be alarmed if PSTH is in the red tomorrow, as this is a very complex deal and the market does not like complexity.  We just need to give it time to absorb the information.

The Vancouver-based company, which reported earnings after markets closed on Thursday, said net sales hit $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up from $651 million during the same time last year. Lululemon also reported a net income of $145 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared to $29 million last year, or 22 cents per diluted share. 

""Our first quarter results reflected strength across all drivers of growth, fuelled by the continued expansion in our e-commerce business and a rebound in brick and mortar stores,"" chief executive Calvin McDonald said in a statement released after markets closed on Thursday. 

""Our strong performance across categories, channels and geographies demonstrates the momentum and strength of Lululemon as we shift into the new normal.""

Lululemon said traffic to its bricks and mortar stores increased significantly in the first quarter of the year, with 93 per cent of the company's retail stores open by the end of the three month period. 

The company also saw growth in both its women's and men's categories. Sales of women's products increased 23 per cent when compared to 2019 sales, and men's sales jumped 27 per cent compared to 2019.

McDonald expects that momentum to continue, even as economies reopen and customers begin to resume normal routines. He said sales growth has continued, even as consumers shift their daily habits. 

""We have not seen a meaningful shift in our activewear categories through the first quarter,"" McDonald said. 

""The big piece of our business and sales are in athletic activewear. I think with that, it has embedded strength to not be purely trend driven or fashion driven... Overall growth is across almost every category and is very balanced across geographies."" 

The stronger-than-expected results pushed Lululemon to raise its sales targets for the full fiscal year. The company now expects net revenue to be between $5.83 billion and $5.91 billion in 2021, up from its prior range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion. Lululemon also expects adjusted earnings to be between $6.73 and $6.86 per share, compared to a prior range of $6.30 to $6.45. 

The projections surpass what analysts had anticipated. According to IBES data from Refinitiv, analysts had expected net revenue of $5.68 billion and earnings of $6.48 per share.

Joe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.

In a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a “rolling basis” the new ban list of about 59 companies.

It also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.


Chips with everything: how one Taiwanese company drives the world economy

The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.

“In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,” Biden said.

A White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.

Major Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

SMIC is key to China’s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

“We fully expect that in the months ahead … we’ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order’s restrictions,” one of the senior officials said.

A second official told reporters that the inclusion of Chinese surveillance technology companies expanded the scope of the Trump administration’s initial order last year, which the White House argues was carelessly drafted, leaving it open to court challenges.

The president has been reviewing a number of aspects of US policy toward China, and his administration had extended a deadline for implementation set by Donald Trump’s order while it crafted its new policy framework.

The move is part of Biden’s broader series of steps to counter China, including reinforcing US alliances and pursuing large domestic investments to bolster American economic competitiveness, amid increasingly sour relations between the world’s two most powerful countries.

Biden’s Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said last month that a period of engagement with China had come to an end and that the dominant paradigm in bilateral ties going forward would be one of competition.

Senior officials said the treasury would give guidance later on what the scope of surveillance technology means, including whether companies are facilitating “repression or serious human rights abuses”.

“We really want to make sure that any future prohibitions are on legally solid ground. So, our first listings really reflect that,” a second senior administration official said.

Investors would have time to “unwind” investments, a third official said.

The new list provided few surprises for investors looking to see if they need to unload even more Chinese stocks and bonds.

But some previously identified companies, such as Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing and Airbus, as well as two companies that had challenged the ban in court, Gowin Semiconductor Corp and Luokung Technology Corp, were not included.

In May, a judge signed an order removing the designation on Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which was among the more high-profile Chinese technology companies that the Trump administration targeted for alleged ties to China’s military."|investing|Biden bans US investment in Chinese military and tech surveillance sectors|4187.0|0.97

**Some Basic Information**

* Rite Aid has only 55 million shares outstanding. Of those, approximately 57.75% are held by institutions and insiders.
* There are 7,860,000 million shares short or about 14.3% of the total outstanding shares. Those familiar with RAD know that it has been a target of short sellers for years who have tried desperately (but failed) to push the company into bankruptcy.
* The company had annual revenue of $24 Billion last year and is projected to hit $25 Billion this year.
* Despite having $24 - $25 Billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid's market cap is barely above $1 Billion.
* The stock price broke above $20 per share on June 2, 2021. The 2021 high share price thus far is $32.48, achieved back in January.
* The company is expected to turn the corner this year and report positive net earnings for the full fiscal year.
* The long-term debt is approximately $3.1 Billion
* Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow last year and will do so again this year.
* Earlier this year, RAD completed an acquisition of Bartell Drugs for just under $100 Million, making Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in Seattle.
* Rite Aid is the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA behind CVS and Walgreens.
* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. Rite Aid now has more than 2,500 retail stores today.
* Some analysis done on Rite Aid has projected that the breakup value of the company is in the range of $39 - $50 per share. (example - [https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor\_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite\_aid\_no\_matter\_how\_you\_cut\_it\_it\_is\_the\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite_aid_no_matter_how_you_cut_it_it_is_the_right/) )

**Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines**

One significant contributor to Rite Aid’s financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose.

At the rate of vaccination projected, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid’s fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A &amp; B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

Finally, with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life-threatenting / chronic diseases. Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid, increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments.

**Potential for RAD to Be Acquired**

While Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid, I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

* Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability
* All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

That being said, today, June 3, 2021, CFRA Research, an independent research organization, issued its latest report concerning Rite Aid and made the following statement:

***""Amazon is looking to increase its physical drug retail business to compete head on with CVS, Walgreens, and RAD. While this would certainly intensify the competitive landscape, we think it will take AMZN considerable time to compete on the same scale as the incumbents since there are over 20k pharmacies among CVS, WBA, and RAD vs. only 350 Whole Foods locations if AMZN were to start at its grocery stores. It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""***

And finally, a potential dark horse suitor has emerged...or re-emerged, I should say.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( WBA ) completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen ( ABC ) for $6.5 billion in a cash and stock deal.  With that $6.5 billion windfall, Walgreens is now is a position to purchase the remainder of Rite Aid, finally completing the acquisition that it set out to accomplish way back in 2015.  Such an acquisition would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:  

\* Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS 

\* Providing Walgreens with a PBM to help it gain share in the prescription drug market and become more competitive in that segment

\* Blocking both Amazon and Walmart from acquiring Rite Aid as part of their pharmacy strategy which would quickly catapult either company into the position of 3rd largest retail pharmacy in the USA  

The race appears to be on to see who will ultimately acquire Rite Aid! 

**Conclusion - Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer**

Rite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24, 2021. I personally believe that the stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of $32.48 as that date approaches.

Then there's the ones who are massive risk takers, borrowing money, trying to YOLO and make millions by the end of the year. Every now and again you hear of someone succeeding but far more fail.

A poll of analysts predicts a 663,000 rise in employment for last month following April’s surprisingly weak 266,000 result, which was less than a third of the expected 1mln hires. The headline jobless rate for May is forecast to fall to 5.9% after the surprise increase to 6.1% in the previous month, and average earnings are seen up sharply on the year. 

The disappointing job growth in April came after the March number was revised upward, which exacerbated reactions, according to analysts. “Rogue payroll figures are certainly not unknown, and our suspicion is that the swing between the two months partly reflects data volatility,” Investec said. “Another possibility is that employment growth was limited by labour supply.”

How does this compare to the global box office industry? From 2019 to 2020 we saw revenues shift in the following:

**2019 -&gt; 2020**

*Global Box Office*

\~42 billion (all-time-record) -&gt; \~11.5 billion

*Gaming Industry*

\~152 billion -&gt; \~164 billion

That’s right, in 2019 (pre-pandemic) the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the box office entertainment industry and over 14x in 2020\*. Gaming’s 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined ([source](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/video-games-2020-revenues-outpace-movies-sports#:~:text=A%2520new%2520report%2520from%2520MarketWatch,both%2520movies%2520and%2520sports%2520combined.)).

&amp;#x200B;

There is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games ([source](https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/15/esa-ceo-64-of-u-s-adults-are-gamers-46-of-players-are-women-older-people-are-playing-more/))

&amp;#x200B;

Check out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.

**eSports**

Another beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to [surpass \~1.1 billion in revenues](https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-esports-growth-idUSFLM4K2cJ7) in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020’s \~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.

**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.

&amp;#x200B;

1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.
2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.
3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).
4. Gaming PCs for those that don’t want to self-customize their own.

**Corsair - Outlook**

With the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games ([source](https://fortunly.com/statistics/video-game-industry-statistics/)). This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.

The target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market ([source](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/gaming-peripheral-branding-data-brands-consumer-research/)). Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.

**Final Thoughts**

Given the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry."|investing|A few notes about Corsair Gaming (CRSR) - The Rise of The Gamer|33.0|0.65

&gt;  
&gt;The vehicle, known as the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, or SMCCF, held $5.21 billion of bonds from companies including Whirlpool Corp. , Walmart Inc. and Visa Inc. as of April 30. In addition, it held $8.56 billion of exchange-traded funds that hold corporate debt, such as the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A Fed official said the sales should be completed by the end of this year. Net proceeds will be remitted to the Treasury Department.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed’s corporate-debt holdings are distinct from its $7.3 trillion balance sheet of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. The central bank is continuing to purchase those types of assets to the tune of at least $120 billion a month as part of its monetary-policy goal of holding down borrowing costs until the economy recovers further from the pandemic.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed added that its corporate-bond and ETF sales “will aim to minimize the potential for any adverse impact on market functioning by taking into account daily liquidity and trading conditions” for ETFs and corporate bonds.

On this last date the MRNA market cap was 7.5 billion. These dates/prices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture. Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at $20. The total market has grown \~40% since then (comparing total market index then and now), which, all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of $28 – not bad. But clearly we’re not factoring in vaccine profits. Moderna was approved in the U.S. in mid December \[1\] and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at $104.47.

This price already seems too high though… depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for $15 to $20 per dose \[2\]. They reached a deal to sell the U.S. 300 million and the EU 150 million doses, generously totaling $10 billion. A one time sale, yet their market cap has increased 10x from 7.5 bil to \~75 bil (read: overbought) \[3\]. The only way this makes ANY sense is if they’re counting on a significant mass of the global population &gt; 1 billion people ( note they have “plans to make 1.4 bil doses in 2022”\[2\]) to purchase booster shots every year. To their credit, they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a “long term” supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022, but this is a far cry from their required numbers (this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now). Do we really think MRNA is going to be able to bring &gt; 1 billion doses to market and find enough willing buyers?

I don't think so, and I think the market reflects my uncertainty. First, Moderna’s main competitor (Pfizer) has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two. \[4,5\] Furthermore, with Pfizer, J&amp;J, Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive. Lastly, and very importantly, a large fraction of the people who haven’t YET got the vaccine never intend to: “nearly 40% of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them”. \[6\] This information, combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought looks to me like a ticking time bomb. MRNA’s boosted position seems incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions (1 yr chart: dec 11, feb 19, may 4th )

And the reason it’s going to dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come. The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case. If they maintain their current market share at \~500 million vaccines per yr (unlikely as we will see), this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the $104 price we saw in January. So the base prediction given information here-to-now is that MRNA will dump to \~$110, a 40% decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all along.

And furthermore, it seems the covid treatment/prevention market may be open to even more competitors outside of vaccines. Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work, Ivermectin is a cheap, not-under-patent, common drug that’s been used for forty years as a common anti-parasitic.

In Latin America, where the U.S. fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found, the people (and the market) have settled on a different solution. “The drug has been so in demand that in May health-care workers passed out some 350,000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia. That same month, the Peruvian police seized around 20,000 bottles of animal-grade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections. And in July, a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30,000 doses to bolster the country’s supply.” \[7\] This article advocates caution because, at the time “data is scant”. But that was many months ago (oct 2020), now the data is in.

What started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish \[8\], but would it do the same to covid in the human body? Well – what was the result of the mass buying in Peru? For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths quickly dropped by 75% after only 45 days. \[9\] “Extraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out.” At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99% effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively. One trial done in Argentina had \~1,200 healthcare workers, \~400 did not take Ivermectin and the other \~800 did. Of the \~400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid. Of the 800 who did take it, 0 (ZERO!) fell ill. \[10,11\] And lastly, meta-analysis studies: “98% of the 52 studies to date report positive effects. Random effects meta-analysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81% reduction, RR 0.19 \[0.09-0.39\], and prophylactic use shows 85% improvement, RR 0.15 \[0.09-0.25\]. Mortality results show 76% lower mortality, RR 0.24 \[0.14-0.42\] for all treatment delays, and 84% lower, RR 0.16 \[0.04-0.63\] for early treatment.” \[12,13\]

Remember when India was getting devastated by covid? Seems like yesterday. Where did all that news go? Well, there’s this: many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult…\[14\]. What about Africa? Didn’t analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster? Well… a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19.. \[15\] How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs? You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease, right? \[16\] That being said, they have applied for full authorization along with Pfizer and will probably get it so this specific point is mostly moot, but still relevant.

So what do you guys think? Seems to me like MRNA is in a bubble and will pop, and the burst could be accentuated by an increasingly competitive market. Love to hear some people who disagree!

TLDR; $HRTX marketing this summer could be huge . PT low of 22 and high of ~70 by Q3 . Rated buy. Currently sits at 13.40 

Heron Therapeutics recently had their newest medication , ZYNRELEF, approved by the FDA and are planning on pushing out the product THIS summer. Helps that they just got $150m to do it with too

Drug info provided by website:
“ZYNRELEF is the first and only extended-release dual-acting local anesthetic (DALA). Its formulation combines bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, with a low dose of meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). They work synergistically in a novel Biochronomer® extended-release polymer that provides controlled diffusion of both ingredients simultaneously over 72 hours at the surgical site.1-5 ZYNRELEF is the only local anesthetic considered by FDA to be extended-release, based on superiority to bupivacaine through 72 hours.” 

TLDR ^ non-opioid painkiller for post-surgery pain 

They’ve also revamped their website and added more info on ZYNRELEF. I see this as incredibly bullish and look forward to Q3 earnings. 

Edit: Adding on, they’ve priced their product at a lower price than competitors. This will surely give them more exposure due to being the less expensive medication. Ethically speaking, they also will aid in stumping the opioid addiction that many painkillers cause. 

[HRTX Provided Slides from conference today (6/1) ](https://herontherapeutics.gcs-web.com/static-files/60511d1d-bf04-45f1-8c5a-9cf50d9554bd) 

I’d see slide 8 for comparisons to others 

I’d give their website a look. What’s more, is that with the pandemic being handled, there will be more freedom and thus, more fuckers getting injured and needing surgery. 

UPDATE AS OF 6/3

New Motley Fool commentary.

“Entering last month, Heron Therapeutics had two FDA-approved drugs on the market. Both were designed to treat nausea in cancer patients. But in mid-May, the Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to Heron's post-surgical pain relief drug Zynrelef. The therapy combines a local anesthetic with an anti-inflammatory drug, and is administered as part of the surgical process. The delayed-release medication provides pain relief for 72 hours after surgery. Heron management believes this is key in helping post-surgical patients avoid the use of opioid pain medications.

The FDA approval was given for a limited set of surgeries: bunionectomy, total knee replacement, and a type of hernia repair. Those account for more than 2.1 million procedures annually, with 60% of those performed in an outpatient setting. Management has indicated it sees the potential for Zynrelef to hit $450 million in annual sales. Heron's other pain management candidate, HTX-034, recently entered phase 2 clinical trials. It aims to extend the pain relief to five to seven days. 

Given a boost from a federal budget that includes significant funds for research and raising awareness about addiction, Heron's opioid alternatives could quickly gain wide adoption in the medical community. Beyond public service campaigns and a speedier approval process, agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid could create incentives for surgeons to use opioid alternatives like Zynrelef. There could also be regulatory support for its use in additional indications. There is already a precedent for Zynrelef's use beyond those initial surgeries approved by the FDA. The drug is authorized in 31 European countries for small- to medium-sized surgical wounds. All of this adds up to a significant opportunity for Heron Therapeutics to grow its sales.”

This is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated.

DISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing.

Intel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it’s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel. AMD is currently expensive and overvalued at the moment. AMD has had no availability in the consumer market for quite some time. Intel is finally the more affordable option again (in terms of consumer parts) due to AMD having very limited availability. In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it’s high and has potential to go back up.

**Finances**

First things first, let’s get into Intel’s financials. Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth:

2017: 62.76B

2018: 70.85B

2019: 71.97B

2020: 77.87B

Intel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year:

In 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017.

In 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018.

In 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019.

In March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020.

**Competition/Growth Potential**

Intel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it’s stock price high of \~$68 in April at \~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth.

Intel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel’s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota.

**Final Thoughts**

Intel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly.

Intel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market.

What are everyone else’s thoughts? I personally believe that Intel is due for a breakout in the next months, but what does everyone else think? I was also wondering about Qualcomm ($QCOM), what does everyone think about that?

EDIT: It seems that Intel is more unstable than I originally thought. Thanks for all the replies."|investing|Why Intel ($INTC) is Undervalued|27.0|0.62

# Assessment of the Uranium Market and Future Outlook

**Disclaimer and disclosure:** I am not a financial advisor and none of the below research constitutes investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell. Always do your own due diligence. I currently have small positions in some of the securities mentioned.

**Note:** Any constructive criticism to improve this DD would be welcome. If you see any red flags or risks I may have missed, please highlight them.

# Highlights

* After a decade-long bear market spurred by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, positive sentiment of uranium and nuclear energy is improving. The construction of new reactors is on the rise, particularly in Asia, and nuclear energy is increasingly seen as essential to helping countries meet their decarbonization targets.
* After Fukushima, uranium supply flooded the market and demand fell, particularly in Japan and Germany, leading to low uranium prices for years. In response to these tough market conditions, mining companies have scaled back production in an attempt to balance a market saturated with the metal. Low uranium prices have also prevented miners from committing to large-scale investments in new mining projects, resulting in uncertainty in future supply.
* Uranium is primarily sold not on the open market but through private, long-term contracts. But given an oversupply of uranium and cheap prices on the spot market, contracted volume has been low for several years as utilities and reactor operators draw on the secondary supply, such as purchasing on the spot market, to make up the deficit between what is delivered through older contracts and what reactors require to keep running.
* But as the secondary supply dwindles and miners maintain production discipline, utilities will face a projected supply shortage and will eventually be incentivized to enter into long-term contracts at higher prices. Furthermore, recent physical uranium purchases from junior miners and investment funds—a new development for the market—signal growing investor interest in the metal and put additional pressure on a limited supply.
* Optimistic investors, market analysts, and industry CEOs largely believe the bear market is ending and a new uranium bull market is emerging. They predict that in the coming decade, demand is set to grow as supply tightens, and as a result, uranium prices will rise (indeed, *must* rise) to incentivize new mining production and fill demand.

# Introduction

This report examines the current uranium market and the thesis that, as demand for nuclear energy grows and supply dwindles, utilities will have to sign new long-term contracts for uranium delivery, causing the price of uranium to increase and initiate a new bull market. While this report covers the uranium market, the politics of nuclear energy, and upcoming catalysts, it does not analyze any specific uranium stocks nor does it recommend any particular investment strategies.

Like most mineral commodity markets, uranium has a history of volatility and typically moves with supply and demand as well as geopolitical forces. For context, in 2017, the world’s top uranium producers were Kazakhstan (39% of world production), Canada (22%), and Australia (10%) with Namibia, Niger, and Uzbekistan playing smaller roles in the market. The largest and most significant uranium [exploration and mining companies](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx) include state-owned Kazatomprom (22% of world production), France’s Orano (11%), Cameco (9%), Uranium One (8%), and CNNC (7%). Finally, the [most productive uranium mine](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/uranium-mining-overview.aspx) is Cigar Lake in Canada (owned by Cameco/Orano with 13% of world production). Notably, Cameco’s McArthur River mine, the world’s largest high-grade uranium deposit, was placed under care and maintenance in 2018 due to low uranium prices.

Before uranium can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors, it goes through a process known as the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle where the uranium is (1) mined and milled into U3O8 (also known as yellowcake, a uranium concentrate powder), (2) converted into UF6, (3) enriched, and then (4) fabricated into fuel. This process is time-consuming and geographically spread out; over the course of 1-2 years, uranium might be mined in Canada, converted and enriched in France, and sent to fuel a reactor in the United States, and utility inventories of uranium might be spread out along this cycle with only a small portion of it immediately ready to fuel a reactor.

# Sentiment on Nuclear Energy

As [one article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/14/is-denison-mines-stock-a-buy/) puts it, “nuclear power has been something of an unloved stepchild in the energy sector.” Indeed, since the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, public opinion has been focused on safety and environmental concerns. In Europe, Germany has reduced their number of reactors from [17 to 6](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/germany.aspx) (and the remaining six are scheduled to be decommissioned by the end of 2022), with the German public broadly opposed to constructing new reactors. In the U.S., according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as of November 2019, there were [23](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php) nuclear power reactors in various stages of decommissioning, with only two new reactors being built.

So is nuclear energy on its way out? Probably not.

In France, where 56 reactors operate, officials recently [extended](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/france-extend-lifetime-old-nuclear-102331515.html) the 40-year lifespan of nuclear plants an additional 10 years. In March, China released its 14th 5-year plan, which [aims](https://www.power-technology.com/news/industry-news/china-five-year-plan-three-points-nuclear-coal-energy-efficiency/) for 70GW of power generation through nuclear energy before 2025 (it hit 51GW in 2020), and the country is currently [building](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/china-nuclear-power.aspx) 16 new reactors to meet this goal. In India, 9 new reactors are under construction. In the U.S., described in more detail below, the Biden administration has adopted a positive stance towards nuclear energy, and some U.S. reactors are starting to [receive](https://www.powermag.com/nrc-issues-first-subsequent-license-renewals-extends-nuclear-reactor-life-to-80-years/) license renewals to operate beyond their original lifespan. Nuclear energy, though it can be controversial even among some experts, is increasingly seen as [essential](https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-nuclear-power-must-be-part-of-the-energy-solution-environmentalists-climate) to meeting decarbonization targets. Overall, the number of new reactors is expected to outpace shutdowns, and as a result, the demand for uranium is projected to increase 1-3% per year in the coming decades.

# Market Overview

Global demand for uranium rose from the 1950s through the 1970s, largely driven by nuclear weapons procurement programs. Then, in the 1980s, various environmental, safety, and economic concerns over nuclear power plants reduced demand; at the same time, the market was flooded with excess uranium, and prices remained depressed throughout the 1990s. As uranium prices fell, producers began curtailing operations or exiting the business entirely, leaving only a few actively involved in uranium mining and causing uranium inventories to shrink significantly.

Uranium prices reached an all-time low in 2001, costing about $7/lb. This was followed by a period of gradual rise (during which three mines either flooded or suffered extreme weather, tightening supply and causing the price to increase further), followed by a bubble culminating in mid-2007, during which the price peaked at around $137/lb. The higher price during the bubble spurred new prospecting and reopening of old mines.

The Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, however, sparked renewed fears about the safety of nuclear reactors and set in motion a decade-long bear market. Demand fell as Japan took all of their reactors offline, and prices ultimately reached a low of around $18/lb. in November 2016 before hitting about $29/lb. in April 2021. The low price of uranium has caused some mining companies to leave the business entirely, such as Westwater Resources (previously Uranium Resources); by [some estimates](http://uraniumequities.com/uranium-reports/2018/10/Canaccord-Uranium-Time-U-Move.pdf), there were nearly 600 uranium mining companies in 2011, but today there are only about 50.

Significantly, prices still remain far below the [$50-$60/lb.](https://www.urnmetf.com/posts/uranium-prices-inflection-point) figure often cited as the all-in cost of production (though some companies can produce for much cheaper), and as long as the spot price remains below the cost of production, mining companies will lack incentive to add more uranium to the market, invest in new mines, or engage in higher-cost production. (Some sources distinguish between the all-in cost of production, which Canada’s [Skyharbour Resources](https://skyharbourltd.com/projects/uranium-projects/uranium-overview/) estimates at around $40/lb., and the “incentive price,” estimated at $50-$60/lb., needed to spur meaningful new production.)

As a result of weak uranium prices and in an effort to reduce available supply, mining companies have strategically cut back on uranium production over the last few years. According to the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-uranium-miners-glow-is-temporary-1512508637?mod=article_inline), in 2017 both Kazatomprom and Cameco, two of the three largest mining companies, reduced or suspended production at uranium mines, and other high-cost mines have been idled or closed down. Further, mines can take more than a decade to plan, build, and begin operation, but low uranium prices make these kinds of large long-term investments financially unsound. As Cameco put it in their [Q1 2021 earnings call](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets-us-west-2/quarterly/CCO-transcript-2021-Q1-call.pdf), “Given the timelines it takes, we should be investing now to replace that lost production, but at today’s prices, that makes zero sense.” As a result, over the last few years, production of mined uranium (i.e., the primary supply) has not kept up with demand, and utility companies have had to purchase uranium from secondary sources such as the spot market, stockpiles, re-enriched depleted uranium tails, and ex-military weapons-grade uranium to keep their reactors going.

The vast majority of uranium is not sold on the open market but through private, long-term contracts between buyers (usually utility companies) and sellers (usually mining companies) with delivery typically beginning about two years after the signing of the contract. In addition, the amount delivered can usually be adjusted plus or minus some percent, depending on the utility companies’ needs, and the price to deliver the uranium may be adjusted with changes in the spot market; Cameco, for instance, targets a ratio of 40% fixed-pricing and 60% market-related pricing in their portfolio of long-term contracts. Roughly [76% of U.S.-purchased uranium](https://www.eia.gov/uranium/marketing/table7.php) delivered in 2020 was bought through long-term contracts and about 24% through spot market purchases. (This is actually historically low; in 2006, it was 90% long term, reflecting the fact that utilities have been relying more on spot purchases in recent years.) There is some speculation that the spot price of uranium will begin to rise when utility companies sign new long-term contracts, a scenario discussed in more detail under “Long-term Contracts.""

## Supply and Demand

Tracking the current levels of supply and demand of uranium can be extremely useful for determining if utilities will begin to enter long-term contracts or continue to purchase from the spot market or other sources. So, how much supply of uranium is in the market and how much demand is there for that supply? Roughly speaking, each year, about 175-180 million lbs. of uranium are consumed globally. Of that, about 120 million lbs. are supplied by miners and the rest is made up from secondary supplies and utility inventories. Though the exact size of the secondary market is difficult to estimate, [Uranium 2020: Resources, Production and Demand](https://www.oecd-nea.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-12/7555_uranium_-_resources_production_and_demand_2020__web.pdf), a joint report by the Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency, suggests the figure is around 10,000 metric tons per year, or 22 million lbs., suggesting a structural deficit between supply and demand that is made up by drawing on material that utilities already have in inventory.

As I mentioned above, in recent years, mining companies have been intentionally reducing the primary supply of uranium on the market. Over the past decade, the primary supply has continually fallen short of global demand, causing a deficit that is filled by a limited and, as the thesis goes, dwindling secondary supply. We can see from the [World Nuclear Association](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/uranium-production-figures.aspx) that after the 2017 production cuts, mined uranium only covered about 80% of world demand.

Tracking secondary supply is both more difficult and more important as its reserves are a key indicator of when utilities will need to enter into long-term contracts. Secondary supply includes stockpiles and inventories of natural and enriched uranium, both civilian and military in origin; nuclear fuel from the reprocessing of spent reactor fuels and from surplus military plutonium; underfeeding; and uranium produced by the re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails. The World Nuclear Association’s [*Nuclear Fuel Report*](https://www.world-nuclear.org/getmedia/b488c502-baf9-4142-8d12-42bab97593c3/nuclear-fuel-report-2019-expanded-summary-final.pdf.aspx) notes, “The majority of secondary supplies are derived from uranium that has undergone transformation in reactors, enrichment plants and reprocessing facilities. The second largest potential secondary resource by mass is the world’s inventory of not-yet-treated used nuclear fuel, held largely at reactor sites.” While this inventory normally accounts for only a relatively small portion of total supply, with low uranium prices and limited mining production, this source has become more significant not only for primary producers and utilities but also for traders and holding companies.

BMO Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley have also written research notes [predicting](https://www.mining.com/stars-are-aligning-for-uranium-price-rally/) “a rally in \[uranium\] prices over the next few years to the \~$50 \[per pound\] level by 2024.” Importantly, both groups also point to uncertainty surrounding just how long existing inventories will last:

&gt;Morgan Stanley warns that “the opacity of the inventory situation remains a key uncertainty to price—see for example palladium, which needed almost 7 years of deficit before the price really took off.” BMO says given the still-high levels of inventories, “acute shortages and price squeezes are extremely unlikely, both for this year and the foreseeable future,” adding that “there is no obvious need for new mine supply in the near future.”

These are important sources of uncertainty that are worth paying attention to. If the uranium bull thesis of an imminent supply deficit ends up being wrong, a miscalculation of existing inventories and market supply will likely be one of the main reasons why (this would, of course, just delay the thesis, if all other factors remained equal). With that said, I somewhat disagree with BMO’s assessment (or maybe just their use of the phrase “near future”), as there is evidence that new/more primary production will be needed by the middle or end of the decade, meaning companies should be investing in those projects today. Remember, utilities and miners operate on a longer timescale than other markets; they sign contracts for 5-10 years, and a reactor with only two years’ worth of uranium is operating akin to just-in-time delivery.

**Now, what about demand?** According to the [International Atomic Energy Agency](https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/home.aspx), there are currently 443 reactors in operation and 52 under construction. Although these reactors require an established, predictable amount of uranium, demand for the metal can still be difficult to estimate, since delays in the construction of new reactors as well as license renewals of old ones can add complications. In the U.S., reactors require about one-fourth of global demand, about 45 million lbs. per year. In February, Bank of America analyst Lawson Winder [speculated](https://www.barrons.com/articles/uranium-miner-cameco-gets-boost-from-sunnier-outlook-for-nuclear-plants-51612283697) that the planned closure of 12 U.S. nuclear power plants this decade could be postponed beyond 2030, adding 26 million pounds to 2021-2030 uranium demand.” Indeed, license renewal has been a growing topic of interest among nuclear and policy experts (as an example, Virginia’s Surry Power Station was [recently granted](https://apnews.com/article/business-f07aefe6a8f4a2fd2a549113bbf1e925) a 20-year extension and several more U.S. renewals are [under review](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/nuclear-industry-sees-opportunities-in-dc-as-infrastructure-talks-heat-up-64165577); even Japan has given the [green light](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/japan-utility-restart-nuclear-reactors-77365378) to operate three reactors for an additional 20 years, helping reach its goal of having 20-22% of its energy come from nuclear power by 2030). Further, we’ve also seen reports that the Biden administration supports subsidies for nuclear plants to prevent them from closing, and Biden’s climate adviser [supports](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/white-house-climate-adviser-says-existing-nuclear-essential-reach-emissions-2021-05-18/) the continued operation of existing nuclear reactors to achieve emissions goals—more on this under “Political and Policy Developments.” Winder adds that a shift “could lead U.S. fuel buyers to move forward plans for major new contracting: Consider that those 26 million pounds are 23% of total U.S. utility inventories at year-end 2019 of 113 million pounds, and inventories today are quite likely lower post 2020’s supply disruptions.” If reactors are kept online longer than expected, utilities would only face greater urgency to sign new contracts for nuclear fuel.

## Political and Policy Developments

## United States

In the United States, throughout his tenure, President Trump exhibited a positive stance towards nuclear energy. In 2018, two U.S. uranium miners, Energy Fuels Inc and Ur-Energy Corporation, filed a Section 232 petition, essentially asking the government to investigate national security concerns regarding foreign uranium imports and asking that 25% of U.S. uranium consumption be met by U.S. producers. Though the Trump administration [ultimately rejected](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/US-President-rejects-uranium-import-restrictions) this petition, it established the Nuclear Fuel Working Group to find alternative solutions to “restore American nuclear energy leadership.” Framed as a way to increase national security and revitalize domestic uranium production, the Working Group [aimed](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/04/f74/Restoring%20America%27s%20Competitive%20Nuclear%20Advantage-Blue%20version%5B1%5D.pdf) to “restore America’s competitive nuclear \[energy\] advantages” and recommended, among other initiatives, to “directly purchase uranium by establishing a uranium reserve.” In December 2020, Congress passed the [Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021](https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf) to fund the government through fiscal year 2021, which set aside $75 million for the Uranium Reserve Program, but the project is still in the early stages and it does not appear that any uranium purchases have actually been made by the U.S. government. (More information on the nuclear- and uranium-related provisions of the 2021 appropriations law can be found [here](https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Congress-approves-nuclear-energy-funding-for-FY202).)

The Biden administration has taken a similarly positive stance towards uranium and nuclear energy. Though there hasn’t been much headline news on the topic, nuclear energy is included in one of the objectives of the [American Jobs Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/) to leverage “carbon pollution-free energy provided by existing sources like nuclear and hydropower” and to manufacture “critical technologies like advanced nuclear reactors and fuel.” Separately, Reuters recently [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/white-house-eyes-subsidies-nuclear-plants-help-meet-climate-targets-sources-2021-05-05/), “The White House has signaled privately to lawmakers and stakeholders in recent weeks that it supports taxpayer subsidies to keep nuclear facilities from closing and making it harder to meet U.S. climate goals.” Biden’s recently [proposed 2022 budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/budget_fy22.pdf), which will likely change before being signed into law, requests $9.75 billion in credits for “electricity generation from existing nuclear power facilities” and $5 billion to “procure advanced nuclear power” over the next ten years.

Furthermore, there is currently a bill in the Senate—[S.4897](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4897/text), the American Nuclear Infrastructure Act—that aims to “to reestablish United States global leadership in nuclear energy, revitalize domestic nuclear energy supply chain infrastructure, support the licensing of advanced nuclear technologies, and improve the regulation of nuclear energy.” The bill has been [approved](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/12/committee-approves-nuclear-infrastructure-legislation-at-business-meeting) by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, but, so far, has not been passed or signed into law.

A smaller, but still positive, signal for the uranium market is that Honeywell’s Metropolis Works plant in Illinois—the U.S.’s sole uranium conversion facility—will [restart](https://www.powermag.com/honeywell-to-reopen-sole-u-s-uranium-conversion-plant/) production of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) by early 2023, citing customer demand and the depletion of secondary supplies of UF6. The plant was idled in 2018 due to the weak market.

## European Union

In the European Union, [countries are divided](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/29616/for-eastern-europe-nuclear-power-depends-on-eu-taxonomy) on nuclear energy, with Germany and Austria opposing it and France, Hungary, and eastern Europe supporting it. In March 2021, the Joint Research Center of the European Commission on nuclear energy released a [report](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/210329-jrc-report-nuclear-energy-assessment_en.pdf) to help the Commission determine whether nuclear energy should be included in the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, which would help incentivize and scale up investment in the industry. (This report followed a previous assessment from the Technical Expert Group \[TEG\] that found “nuclear energy has near to zero greenhouse gas emissions” but that more research was needed due to a “lack of operational permanent experience of high-level waste disposal sites.”) The JRC report concludes that there is no evidence that “nuclear energy does more harm to human health or to the environment than other electricity production technologies already included in the Taxonomy.” The report adds, “The nuclear energy-based electricity production and the associated activities in the whole nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. uranium mining, nuclear fuel fabrication, etc.) do not represent significant harm to any of the TEG \[Technical Expert Group\] objectives.” While this is a positive sign for EU endorsement of nuclear energy, some uncertainty remains. This report is currently being [reviewed](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/e%20n/qanda_21_1805) by two sets of independent experts, the Group of Experts on radiation protection and waste management under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty and the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks on environmental impacts. The two Committees have three months to issue their assessment, and the two assessment reports, along with the JRC report, will inform the Commission's decision.

## Non-utility Purchasing of Uranium

One final significant development in the uranium market is the purchasing and stockpiling of the metal by non-utility companies, particularly miners and physical asset management companies, signaling growing positive sentiment in the market. Mining companies may buy uranium for a variety of reasons, such as in order to meet purchase agreements or to build up collateral, but the recent moves also suggest renewed optimism that uranium prices may finally be ready to move up. In its Q1 2021 financial results, Cameco [noted](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets-us-west-2/quarterly/CCO-2021-Q1-MDA-FS-and-Notes.pdf) that, in total, “Through April this year junior uranium companies and financial funds had purchased approximately 10.5 million pounds U3O8.” (Additionally, pp. 7-8 of that link provides a good overview of the most recent developments in the uranium market.) Some recent purchases by miners include:

* In March, Australia’s **Boss Resources** [agreed to purchase](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Uranium-companies-increase-inventory-from-spot-mar) 1.25 million pounds of U3O8
* In March, **Uranium Royalty Corp.** (URC) [exercised](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Uranium-companies-increase-inventory-from-spot-mar) its option to buy 348,000 lbs from Yellow Cake. Notably, URC has the option to acquire anywhere from $2.5-$10 million worth of uranium per year from Yellow Cake for nine years, so the fact that they bought the maximum amount is an optimistic sign, and investors should watch for a similar purchase in Q1 2022.
* In March, **Denison Mines** [purchased](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/denison-announces-successful-procurement-of-2-5-million-lbs-u3o8-as-part-of-project-finance-initiative-301260450.html) 2.5 million lbs.
* In April, **Uranium Energy Corp.** [purchased](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uranium-energy-corp-expands-physical-uranium-initiative-to-purchase-2-1-million-pounds-u3o8-and-announces-financing-301262497.html) 2.1 million lbs. scheduled to be delivered at various points through 2023. Then, in May, they [announced](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334933/000118374021000106/ex991-20210520uec.htm) an additional 200,000 lb. purchase.
* In April, **enCore Energy** [purchased](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/encore-energy-corp-announces-strategic-acquisition-of-physical-uranium-865933152.html) 200,000 lbs.
* In May, **Cameco** [said](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Cameco-increases-uranium-purchases-to-meet-contrac) that it expects to purchase 11-13 million lbs. of uranium in 2021 to meet contracted demand, which is up from their previous estimate of 8-10 million lbs.

Trusts and funds have also been buying up uranium, with London-listed Yellow Cake purchasing nearly 4 million pounds in March 2021 by exercising an option to buy from Kazatomprom, bringing its [total holdings](https://otp.investis.com/clients/uk/yellow_cake/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=2392&amp;newsid=1470152) to 12.96 million lbs. In April, Sprott Asset Management [announced](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/28/2218439/0/en/Sprott-Asset-Management-Enters-Into-Agreement-With-Uranium-Participation-Corporation-to-Form-the-Sprott-Physical-Uranium-Trust.html) that it would take over management of and restructure the Uranium Participation Corporation to form the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT) and list it on the NYSE—UPC currently holds 16.27 million lbs. of U3O8 and 660,000 lbs. of UF6.

One of the main effects of these uranium holding companies purchasing the commodity is that they remove supply from the spot market, thus limiting the amount available for miners and utilities to buy and further pressuring utilities to enter into long-term contracts. There is also speculation that Sprott’s upcoming purchases on the spot market will drive the uranium price up, making spot purchases less attractive for utilities. Sprott will likely utilize at-the-market raisings so that if its share price trades at a premium to NAV, it will issue new shares, raise funds, and purchase additional uranium. As one article [puts](https://articles.cruxinvestor.com/sprotts-physical-uranium-trust-to-change-the-uranium-game) it, “ATM \[At-the-market\] raisings are a well-worn path for Sprott, having raised around $4B this way into their bullion trusts over the past 15 months. This structure will enable SPUT to consistently nibble (if not gobble) at the bid in the spot market—the perfect way to fray fuel buyer nerves and terrify producers that need to obtain spot uranium for their contracted deliveries.”

The Sprott transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021 (the shareholder meeting is currently set for July 7) and seek a listing on the NYSE. Sprott already manages four other physical commodity trusts across gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, and the addition of uranium suggests strong investor interest in the commodity. Cameco [called](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/new-uranium-trust-could-be-game-changer-for-spot-market-cameco-says-64158423) the move by Sprott a “game changer” for the spot market. (I’ll add that the [Q1 2021 Cameco call](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets-us-west-2/quarterly/CCO-transcript-2021-Q1-call.pdf) had some interesting things to say about Sprott \[on pp. 33 and 50\] as well as the miner purchases \[pp. 32-33, 39-40\].)

# Long-term Contracts

As noted above, the majority of uranium purchased by utilities comes from long-term contracts. Based on UxC data (found in a [Cameco report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1009001/000119312521035711/d121720dex3.htm)), the last significant contracting “cycle” was from 2005-2012 with large numbers of contracting volumes from 2005-2007, 2010, and 2012. Since then, long-term contracting has dropped significantly, particularly from 2019 to 2020, where the volume of long-term contracting went from 95.8 million lbs. to about 53 million lbs. At the same time, spot contracting increased to \~80 million lbs. in 2020, the highest level in the past two decades (I apologize for the less-than-ideal quality of the chart; the fault is Cameco’s or UxC’s). In Cameco’s view, lower contracting volumes in 2020 could be attributed in part to “utilities focusing on operational safety amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.” During 2020, there were also a number of U.S. policy uncertainties stemming from the Nuclear Fuel Working Group and the [Russian Suspension Agreement](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/100620-new-russian-uranium-suspension-agreement-takes-effect-says-commerce).

One way of thinking about where utilities are today in terms of contracting is to look at how much uranium utilities anticipate needing each year compared to how much they’ve already contracted for delivery. As I mentioned above, when utilities sign long-term contracts the amount delivered can vary some amount to meet their needs, so there’s a minimum and maximum range that might be delivered to utilities. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) [2020 Uranium Marketing Annual Report](https://www.eia.gov/uranium/marketing/), which just came out in May, gives us a helpful chart (below) showing the maximum amount of uranium already under contract as well as the unfilled market requirements (i.e., what utilities need but haven’t contracted for). Combined, these values give us the maximum anticipated market requirements of uranium for U.S. nuclear reactors. We see that even as overall demand remains relatively steady, the maximum contracted amount of uranium falls steeply throughout the decade. For the next one to two years, that shortfall might be able to be made up by purchasing on the spot market or drawing on existing utility inventories, but considering that long-term contracts typically begin uranium delivery two years after the contract is signed, utilities will likely need to sign new contracts soon.

Ultimately, no one knows when utilities will start to enter into long-term contracts again, but we know their inventories are shrinking, demand is growing, and future supply is becoming more uncertain as miners and investment funds purchase additional uranium from the spot market.

# Market Performance

How has the uranium market responded to all of these events? Generally, equities have run ahead of the spot price to the point where, since December of last year, many miners have doubled or tripled in share price. Year to date (up to May 27), the Global X Uranium ETF (URA) is up 43% and the North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF (URNM) is up 50%. Other notable uranium stocks are also strong, including Denison Mines (DNN, +78%), Uranium Energy Corp (UEC, +73%), Cameco (CCJ, +46%), NexGen Energy (NXE, +62%), and Energy Fuels (UUUU, +50%) among others. The spot price, on the other hand, has remained around $30/lb.

If you look at any of the charts for these equities, you see a spike around December, marking when a [Bear Traps Report](https://www.thebeartrapsreport.com/) on uranium went out, and the URNM ETF saw record inflows. Looking at the charts, it can be tempting to think it’s too late to get in. Even buying two or three months ago would put one in a good position leading up to catalysts in the second half of the year. But in a lot of ways the bull market is just getting started. The spot price is still currently sitting around $30/lb., and analysts like [Canaccord](https://app.box.com/s/y6evjvtwf7qmvlw02puz5utokmtcs52f) predict the price may reach $60/lb. by the end of 2025. For me, the run-up in equities and the upcoming catalysts, like the U.S. listing of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, mean I can’t be as patient as I’d like when building my positions.

# Upcoming Catalysts

Investors who believe a new uranium bull market is on the horizon or who are looking for additional evidence should keep the following catalysts in mind, in no particular order:

* The **European Union** is set to decide, around June 2021, whether nuclear energy should be considered as part of its taxonomy of sustainable activities. Though Germany has notably turned away from nuclear energy, if the EU considers nuclear energy to be clean and safe, it would pave the way for more reactors in central and eastern Europe.
* In the U.S., investors should **watch for the establishment of a uranium reserve** (for which $75 million has already been allocated for 2021) and the passage of the Nuclear Infrastructure Act.
* **Watch for updates on mining production.** If miners continue to show production discipline, supply will be limited.
* **Watch for updates on reactor license renewals.** If a reactor/plant receives a license renewal, that will represent an increase in uranium demand that likely did not appear in projections.
* **Watch for continued uranium purchases from non-utility entities**, as this limits supply on the spot market and will encourage the signing of long-term contracts.
* **Watch for the U.S. listing of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust**, expected in the third quarter of 2021—this is the most significant near-term catalyst, in my opinion.
* **Watch for news on long-term contracts.** I suspect any new contracts would be announced during quarterly financial results, though earlier indicators may come in the form of a rising spot price or share price of a mining stock.

# Risks and Uncertainty

Though a number of market observers anticipate an increase in the price of uranium due to growing demand and tightening supply, some uncertainty and risk remains.

* Uranium inventory and supply may be greater than estimated, which might delay the bull market by years.
* Producer discipline may break down in the next few years, leading to additional uranium supply on the market and reducing the chances of a dramatic price increase.
* In my research, I have yet to come across any articles or interviews from the perspective of utilities that examine why they are delaying signing long-term contracts and risking security of supply. Knowing this would provide a fuller picture of market dynamics.
* Although the [World Nuclear Association](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide.aspx) estimates that roughly 50 nuclear reactors are being constructed today, it’s not uncommon for these projects to be canceled or postponed, reducing the demand for uranium they would have required if they were up and running.
* Black swan event: the possibility of another Fukushima-like nuclear disaster would significantly dampen demand for uranium and nuclear energy.

# Conclusion

After a decade-long bear market spurred by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, positive sentiment of uranium and nuclear energy is once again improving. But low uranium prices over the past several years have led to underinvestment in the sector, leading to a lack of new mining projects to fill projected demand. As a result, utilities may face a supply crunch in the coming years and will eventually be pressured to enter into long-term contracts at higher uranium prices. Furthermore, recent physical uranium purchases from junior miners and investment funds—a new development for the market—signal growing investor interest in the metal and put additional pressure on a limited supply. Investors hoping to profit from a potential bull market should expect a volatile 2-4-year trade, especially if they choose to hold positions in individual miners and explorers, though they may also choose to mitigate that volatility by holding ETFs or physical asset companies."|investing|Assessment of the Uranium Market and Future Outlook (long post)|217.0|0.92

The Reserve Bank of India’s decision to remove a 2018 rule that forbid banks from facilitating cryptocurrency trades comes as a welcome relief for a community facing push-back from traditional lenders needed to help settle these deals.

The regulator late on Monday told banks not to cite a 2018 central bank circular as a reason to hinder crypto trades. The 2018 note had forbid banks from facilitating such transactions, but has since been struck down by the Supreme Court. Banks must continue with other routine due diligence measures on the deals, the RBI said.

”The circular is no longer valid from the date of the Supreme Court judgment, and therefore cannot be cited or quoted from,” the RBI said.

The RBI order follows local media reports that financial firms, including SBI Cards &amp; Payment Services Ltd., one of India’s biggest credit card issuers, and the nation’s largest private-sector bank HDFC Bank Ltd. had cautioned customers against dealing in virtual currencies. Indian authorities have repeatedly expressed concern that crypto assets could be used for criminal activity such as money laundering and funding terrorism.

“Investing in crypto has always been 100% legal in India and the new RBI circular clearly confirms the right to do business with crypto firms,” said Avinash Shekhar, co-Chief Executive Officer at ZebPay, India’s oldest crypto exchange. He added that the clarification will attract more investors to the virtual currencies.

The RBI’s broader concerns and banks’ worries around money laundering should help to spur regulations and make the industry safer and stronger, said Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of crypto exchange CoinDCX.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was little changed as of 12:15 p.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday, after having gained in the two previous sessions.

Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people's attention. I think it's worth looking further to see what's out there.

Starting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),

1. SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP) . ""Growth at a Reasonable Price"" (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or ""TTM"" net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  SPGP's historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!

Moving on to Factor ETFs,

2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.

3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.

4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.

5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.

6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles ""quality"" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for ""profitability"", ""solvency and financial risk"", and ""earnings quality"".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.

Let us not forget commodities,

7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and ""flat"" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.

8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.

Seeking dividends?

9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.

Finally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,

10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.

Disclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).

7. Market fragmentation geographically, along the value chain and volatile changes in liquidity of investment vehicles.
8. A short squeeze or rapid transfer of capital to the long side of a stock to prevent losses from bears .
9. A weak share price over the last few years to help justify the reduction in holdings for non financial reasons (ESG)
10. A sharp drop in share price owing to very temporary news
11. No/unreasonably small increase in the cost of similar options with longer durations and or closer to the money strike prices
12. Contracts that cost less than $0.10 that could be exercised for a profit in less than a week of steady gains equal to 1/3 the average daily price move
13. Focus on absolute changes in value over the relative changes in value that would result from different commodities influencing the demand for each other and what would cause the relationship to become decoupled or distorted
14. Commodities with a high number of end uses but a low number of alternative goods.
15. Unhedged, dirty beta and less than liquid are desirable only if there is a below average number of market participants.
16. There should be clear indications of shortages in some regions or countries.
17. China will need it to fuel growth in the future.
18. There is always significant arb opportunities but they are hard to capture
19. Under no circumstances could a new technology or innovation disrupt the market for this commodity in the near-mid future
20. A high barrier to entry and limited number of quality companies in the industry.

**Current Examples: BTE July and June Calls 1.5 Strike picked up at 15 cents.**

Look at my post history:  The numbers don't lie and **BIR**, TK, DBA calls have been major gains.

I studied energy infrastructure in China and spoke to officials in the government overseeing energy legislation. I interviewed the top commentators and public + private fund managers. I have 5 papers and a ton of reports to back up my FA. Empirical evidence mounting and market validation up the wazooo.

**Spoiler Alert**: Natural Gas and Condensate producers are priced as if they will rise in a linear and predictable way that mirrors their 5 year downward trend caused by an event that cannot be replicated to the extent it was 5 years ago.

I have waited until a significant number of these experimental trades have been executed and studied by myself in an open and transparent process involving me making posts in communities on the internet including this forum outlining the opportunity and specific rational for that contract. So far the average position size of $122.5 USD has returned $660.00 dollars net of tcosts and borrowing fees over a period of 1 year.

2 contracts have expired worthless and only one of them was never ITM. Why do electricity and nat gas prices SPIKE when expressed as the share price of ETPs employing a VIX like rolling of  (constant maturity futures)? The inability to store the physical commodity in order to offset the risk of delivering a future contract at a price many times higher than both spot and long dated contracts cannot be mitigated for volatility, gas and electricity  like with other commodities.

In a 2018 study by Avellaneda and Papanicolaou the VIX volatility skew and tail size compared to that only of other commodities that can not be stored and distributed easily (electricity and nat gas).

Partial backwardation periods for Nat Gas are common during severe weather events and create periods where the spot price rises well above the long term average price. A temporary rise in commodity price is enough to generate a slightly delayed and less significant, but both in absolute/relative terms large enough to cause the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the calls to more than double in addition to premiums for hedges to increase as well.

Because the lower liquidity of natural gas derivatives, hedging using longer dated futures as opposed to options is far more common and retail investors can take advantage by needing less liquidity to hedge long positions in small cap stocks and realize gains by exercising or selling the calls.

The time decay is offset by several unique characteristics. The first consideration is the ability of the natural gas producer to lock in sales at peak prices due to the extreme social and economic cost of forgoing electricity generation using gas turbines and diverting residential heating fuel. This means selling cash secured puts and exercising some calls with the residual risk capital left over from subtracting the cost of buying the calls from the return. The long term change in retained earnings and book value of the company will prevent a mean reversion in the stock price following the spot prices rapid correction. The common shares left over then become ideal for CC writing and selling cash secured puts while IV is high but new earnings and sticky commodity prices help prop up share prices.

The importance lies in timing of buying of options contracts designed to cost small amounts of premium over time, in exchange for a return on investment that is many times the value of expired contracts. During periods of very low volatility, purchasing the majority of OTM and longer dated contracts gives the ability to max the return on capital due to gamma and the lower marginal cost increases when buying longer dated contracts."|investing|Fat Tail Distributions and Hunting Dirty Beta Plays|17.0|0.79

1622503389.0|0.0|t3_npg51m|139.0|"FRX, Beachbody, &amp; MYX Fitness recently announced the three-way merger vote date. It is scheduled for 6/24/21 at 10AM. Beachbody is marketing themselves as the PTON for the masses.

Here are my thoughts:

$PTON had $1.82B of revenue in 2020. It currently trades at a market cap of roughly 32.9B. $FRX / $BODY is on track for $1.1B in revenue this year and is being valued at roughly 2.9B after the merger is completed.... I think we have some upside here...

Peloton’s trailing 12 months revenue is currently at 3.692B. Again $FRX soon to be $BODY is on track to hit 1.1B this year. That’s plenty of upside for the short term.

Long term they are projected to hit 3.3B by 2025. With the integration of all parts of their business (Bikes, Supplements, Connected Fitness Subscriptions Services, OpenFit App, BODi, etc.) the value for each new customer acquired goes up. Plus, they will have a marketing war chest (400M+ in cash if I remember correctly from an interview) after the merger to achieve their growth target.

Beachbody has also been profitable for the 18 of the last 20 years they’ve been in business. Unlike many other SPACs and growth companies they’ve proven they can generate income.

Once all aspects of their NEW business model come together, they will be able to sell the equipment, the subscriptions, and nutrition supplements directly on their platforms. Imagine completing an interactive workout from the bike and being able to purchase all your nutritional supplements directly from the screen with a few taps.

Each customer acquired will mean much more revenue than strictly subscriptions can bring in alone.

Are you buying? What are your reasons for and against the Beachbody, MYX Fitness, and FRX three-way merger?

Scientists say the system could be used to find ‘hidden gems’ of research overlooked by other methods, and even to guide decisions on funding allocations so that it will be most likely to target promising research....

The researchers then used the system to correctly identify 19 of the 20 ’seminal’ biotechnology papers from 1980 to 2014 in a blinded study, and to select another 50 papers published in 2018 that they predict will be among the top 5% of ‘impactful’ biotechnology research papers in the years to come....

* EBITDA margins for the two co's separately are around 30%, so I'm not even sure where Management's big synergy assumptions are being plugged in. If anyone understand this let me know. It seems very conservative.
* NWC held at 15%, above the historical \~10% of the two separate Co's.
* Debt set to be paid back to target 42b in 2023, and then held at 3x EBITDA.
* Interest set at 3.0%, as mentioned in Malone interview.
* Capex set at 4b/yr, above depreciation, which is set to historical average of both Co's 5% of revenue. This 4b/yr over five years equals the 20b management is planning to spend.
* The deal won't close until mid-late-2022, so you could factor in some delay in the model for this. I did not do that.

So, just to catch anyone up who is just joining:

Hertz filed for bankruptcy. 

Turns out they were not that bankrupt.

Everybody is getting made whole except for the shareholders.

Shareholders of Class 11 stock that pre-pandemic traded at $20 (now trading $6) are getting bought out.

The payout is in three parts:

1) Cash in the amount of $1.53 per share, plus 

2) Pro Rata shares of (a) 3% of the Reorganized Hertz Parent Common Interests (estimated to be $1 per share), plus

**3) Either:**

**a) 30-year warrants for 18% of the equity in the Reorganized Debtors struck at an equity value of $6.5 billion, or**

**b) rights to participate in a $1.635 billion offering for approximately 35% of Reorganized Hertz Parent Common Interests at a per share price based on a total equity value of approximately $4.7 billion. (Subscription Rights)**

This post is a ""deep dive""/""open discussion"" of the third portion above in bold.

**a) 30-year warrants -** waiting for confirmation. It is believed that these warrants have a strike price of $10. So, an example would be a Warrant is issued with a strike price of $10. New Hertz shares are trading at $15 per share. Warrants can be sold or executed. If sold, warrants typically sell for market price less strike price. So, each warrant would be worth $5. Add to the cash of $1.53 + the equity distribution of $1. Total value $7.53.

**b) Subscription rights -** there are 2 types of subscription rights

**1) Eligible Shareholder** \- accredited investors and institutions. Look it up yourself if you don't know if you are. But basically, you must be a broker, bank or have a net cash worth of $1,000,000.

**2) Ineligible Shareholder** \- everybody else. Probably 99% of the people reading this post.

**What I know about subscription rights:**

Basically, what I learned today is that you can participate in an auction prior to the conclusion of the bankruptcy for share in the new company. 

If you are an Eligible shareholder, you can enter a maximum auction price. If the auction goes above the price you set, then you do not purchase any shares.

If you are an Ineligible shareholder, you can enter a minimum auction price. If the auction does not get to the price you set, you automatically are issued New Warrants in the Hertz.

*Actual language below.*

**Item 9. Election Form for Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholders** 

The undersigned is an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and elects to sell its Subscription Rights pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction as follows: 

$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ per Subscription Right (the “Minimum Auction Price”) 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Subscription Rights 

To calculate the maximum number of Subscription Rights that an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder may elect to sell, an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder should multiply the number of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds by 1.0467. 

Note: If you are an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and do not wish to elect to have your Pro Rata share of the Shareholder Subscription Rights sold pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction described below, **no action is necessary,** and you do not need to return this form. 

**Item 10. Election Form for Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholders** 

The undersigned is an Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and elects to purchase Subscription Rights (if any) pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction as follows: 

$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ per Subscription Right (the “Maximum Auction Price”) 

Up to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Subscription Rights

Note: If you are an Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and do not wish to elect to purchase Shareholder Subscription Rights that may be sold pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction, **no action is necessary,** and you do not need to return an election.

BarkBox is a spac that today approved the merger. The Ticker $stic will be $bark on June 2nd.

Many of these subscription box companies get a bad reputation because there were so many grocery ones that lose billions for years and the pet ones made no money because all they did was get existing products and package them where the margins were horrible. 

Nevertheless, barkbox is different. They own all of the products they put in the box, we call that vertically integrated. Have a retail store and sell the products at target and other online and offline stores. So, given the higher Margins, vertical integration, new revenue channels and fast growth I think the valuation should be more expensive than chewy on a price to sales multiple. Lets not discount that the subscription model will evolve over time churn is around 5% to 6% which is excellent. 

The company actually has a few revenue channels: 

buy subscription (you can customize as well), 

add on products to the box, 

dental (medical and preventative is new and will grow), 

meal plan (sends you monthly box of daily meals; crazy but people/dogs can be picky about food), 

ecommerce/retail where they sell the products on amazon, pet stores etc. this is an interesting business because it is not just ecommerce or subscription because they own a lot of the products they sell as their brand where they have exclusive supplychain and distribution agreements. They also have licensing with plush toys with NBA (example). They realized customers are crazy and treat dogs like people so do stuff accordingly. 

No doubt they will sell clothes, costumers, more medical stuff like fleak tick products to help keep the customes within the ecosystem. 

The ceo is actually new started in september 2020 and has options priced at $16 a share. He came from amazon and ebay and before that consultant at infosys. I think the management hire was an excellent decision as it allows then to scale their ecommerce business and get new customers into the ecosystem via subscriptions or not. I see the subscription revenue as potentially amazon prime stuff where people will just fill it up with what they need and not just junk all the time and people will be happy with that and some add-ons here and there. 

The pet business is a fantastic long-term business as boomers age, etc. strategy for this is to buy and either hold or sell when it hits $20 to $30 if there becomes too much hype. This range of valuation is based in Price to Sales. The bottom I used was 2 times given Its growth rate and almost double the gross margin of chewy and even pet supermarket stores. The guidance for this year has room for upside 

I built a ten year model and see then becoming profitable by 2023, however, all of their cash flow is going into growing the business as I think they can sustain a 30% revenue per year for a few years. I do think there are some potential risks such that the Barkeats business could do poorly if the pricing is not competitive or people change the product mix of the box to less profitable products or cancel all together.

The problem I've run up against is that, when the market dumps, everything seems to dump together - in other words, assets that didn't seem correlated or were inversely correlated sometimes become strongly correlated when the market is doing poorly, thus sort of defeating some of the protective intent of diversify through non-correlated assets. 

According to your experience, is there any way around this, statistically speaking? Are there different correlation tests that you've found to be more effective for diversification? Is it perhaps best to invest in newer assets in price discovery mode, or to invest broadly by small amounts in any assets that have been least affected by market-wide downturns in the past?

Their app and website don’t even have any language other than Simplified Chinese. However, it is a public company listed in the US stock market. Pinduoduo an e-commerce platform. It offers a suite of product categories just like Amazon and Walmart in the US.

**The Numbers Seem Impossible Yet It is**

**We do believe whatever in the 26 May, 2021 quarterly financial report is definitely real. However, even we do believe it is real, still it raises some concerns to the company.**

***We do assume no one is using Pinduoduo outside China.***

**The User Numbers**

It stated that the average monthly active users in the quarter was 724.6 million. Also, the monthly active users refers to the number of user accounts that visited the Pinduoduo mobile app during a given month, which does not include those that accessed the platform through social networks and access point.

Active buyers on Pinduoduo in the 12-month period ended March was about 824 million. Active buyers refers to the number of user accounts that placed one or more orders, regardless of whether the products and services are actually sold, delivered or returned.

However, let’s compare some well known e-commerce companies in China. Alibaba has 811 million active buyers, and JD has 499 million active buyers. The last two definitely have more people know outside or within China. Even a lesser know Meituan has 510.6 million paying users and you do see their delivery bicycles on every street in China. They are also all having much longer history than Pinduoduo.

What is the concept of 824 million in China alone, let’s quote the Chinese Official data.

Chinese netizens have 898 million in 2020. The internet availability rate was 70.4%. A total of 986 million Chinese used mobile phones to surf the internet, accounting for 99.7 percent of the online population. Around 309 million, or 31.3% of the online population, live in rural areas.

Which means more than 90% people in China who have internet access are using Pinduoduo and made a purchase on the website or the app within this 12 month period. It included part of those those around 300 million people who lived in rural areas and there monthly salary is less than $2000 RMB ($314).

**Underweight**

**We are not by any means questioning the authenticity of the report, we do believe it is real.**

However, there would not be a huge growth rate for Pinduoduo active users. The average revenue per user is just one-fifth of Alibaba’s because Pinduoduo targets the lower end users, and the way they attract users is by giving them a subsidiary (coupons or cash equivalent) to keep their products price lower than other e-commerce platform. That’s just like burning money no matter which way you see it. It can be doing that forever. Because of that, many big brands are hesitant, if not, unwilling to open an official online flagship store in Pinduoduo. Hence, these are the reasons why we believed that Pinduoduo stock price is overpriced by a lot."|investing|Almost Impossible Number For Pinduoduo PDD|12.0|0.69

**""The New Warrants may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.""**

I didn't know what this meant, so I looked it up.  It means you don't have to have the$10 per share to exercise the warrant.  They will take it out of the proceeds from converting all the warrants. Ask your broker if they participate.

**Example:** 

You have 1000 shares at $6 a share. Your investment is $6000.

You first receive $2.53^(1) per share. So cash payout of $2530.

Then, you receive 1040^(2) warrants for the shares with a strike price of $10^(2).

The new stock is trading at $15 a share. (Estimate from the plan)

Your brokerage exercises the warrants in full with zero cash from you.

You now have 1040 shares of new stock at $15 a share for a total value of $15,600.

But, you owe the strike money that the brokerage put up for you of $10 a share.

You owe $10400. $10400 divided by 15 is 694.

They sell and take 694 shares to repay your strike money.

Leaving you with 346 shares worth $5200.

$5200 in stock + $2530 in cash = $7730.

A profit of $1730 or 28% ROI.

The methodology they used is to look into the past decade's returns and see how much of the return was attributed to each of the following: 

* Valuation Change (P/E or P/B re-pricing)
* Earnings Growth (increase in EPS)
* Dividend Yield
* Foreign Exchange

For the past decade, 5.4% of the US over-performance over international equity was attributed to valuation change. They expect that in the next decade the valuations of US equities will contract (P/E multiples to go down). This will be one of the main reasons for the under-performance.

Have been pondering this some time since rates were dropped down to zero last year. With rates close to zero and future increases being negative for bond prices, why wouldn't it make sense to take some money out of bonds and place it into financially healthy blue chips with reasonable (but not too high) dividends? 

By ""financially healthy"" I would typically include dividend yield between 2%-4%, payout ratio below 50% or 60%, debt to equity below 1 or preferably below 0.75,  free cash flow margin above 10%, and a solid cash balance (can't get very specific since it varies heavily by industry). These attributes typically apply to large/megacap stocks so that wouldn't be a requirement but it'd usually fit the bill. 

My thinking is that rates being at 0% negatively affect bonds in two ways: lower yield (10 year treasury is about 1.6% right now) and less upside as prices will get dinged when rates inevitably rise. Another point is that bonds underperform during bouts of inflation although that's another conversation entirely. I know that equities are obviously more volatile during recessionary periods but with so much of the upside of bonds stripped away I don't see why this wouldn't be a decent strategy as long as rates are low. 

What would some downsides be to this strategy? From a portfolio management standpoint  Would love to hear additional opinions, particularly risks that I haven't mentioned here."|investing|Replacing bonds with blue chips yielding 2%-4%|29.0|0.79

I have invested in some inverse leveraged ETFs, and their performance over the last however many years has been just fine. If I buy the ETF at a low market price, why would it not eventually go back up, as it has cyclically over the course of maybe 10 years or more?

Is there something going on that is going to take money out of my position and steal some of the shares I own? Is the ETF somehow withdrawing cash from my positions?

Or is the concern limited to the simple performance of the fund?

&gt;Snowflake shares fell as much as 8% in extended trading on Wednesday after the data-analytics software company barely met analysts’ expectations for product revenue, the company’s main source of total revenue, for the full fiscal year.

&gt;Here’s how the company did:

&gt;* Earnings: Loss of 70 cents per share
* Revenue: $228.9 million, vs. $212.9 million expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

&gt;Revenue grew 110% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, which ended on April 30, according to a statement. In the previous quarter revenue increased by 117%. The company’s net loss swelled to $203.2 million from $93.6 million.

&gt;For the full 2022 fiscal year Snowflake called for $1.020 billion to $1.035 billion in product revenue, which at the middle of the range implies 86% growth and is more than the $1.02 billion FactSet consensus.

Projected to hit $1B in revenue this FY as a 9 year old company in a space where they're directly competing with the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

1622071053.0|0.0|t3_nlu7ln|42.0|"As I posted before, **you will** get a cash payout of $2.53 per share for each Hertz share you own. That is not in question.

Plus, and here is where the confusion is, you will get 1.04 Stock warrants for each share you currently own. Each warrant is good for buying 1 share of the reorganized Hertz for $10.

So, **what is a warrant** and **what is the warrant worth**?

**The warrant is** the right to purchase a share of a company at a designated strike price. So even if Hertz is trading at $15 a share, you would have the right to purchase a share at $10.

**The warrants worth is** market determined. You can choose to do 1 of two things (for this example, we will use $15 as the current price at which the new reorganized Hertz is trading):

**1)** Exercise the warrant - buy the share for the $10 and for this example you would instantly increase your position to from the $10 you spent to the $15 current trade price.

**2)** Sell the warrant - you can sell\\trade the warrant just like any option. The only difference is that you would instantly receive a cash distribution. You would essentially sell you warrants for $5 per warrant. The new owner would now own the right to exercise, and you will receive the cash difference to the current market price.

**Example (the one used by the investor group that is purchasing HTGQ):**

So, in this case the total value of the HTZGQ stock is the $2.53 cash plus the $5 warrant value. Which totals $7.53 on a stock that is currently trading at $6. That is a 25% ROI in 3 weeks if you invested today.

There is the possibility that the new reorganized shares will trade at less than $13.50 a share. Which would mean $2.53 plus 3.50 or less. Total of $6.03 or less. Which would mean you would only break even or lose money at today’s price of $6.

**Here is where I insert that I am not a professional financial advisor, and you should consult yours before investing.** *My belief is this.... Hertz traded in the* ***$20-$40*** *range for the 5 years prior to the pandemic. It had shaky financials for years leading up to the stress test of the pandemic and their failure. But now it has a reduced debt structure and a hot rental market. I must believe that the new Hertz will trade at the same or higher than its previously debt burdened self.*

I think the shares of the reorganized Hertz land in the mid $20's the first day of trading. if this happens 1 share will be worth $2.53 + $10 = $12.53. So, at today’s price of $6, you would see a 200%+ return in 3 weeks.

I don’t think it’s particularly much of a secret, but just hear me out. They tend to start up a small business operation for a while, and just run within their org. If things turn out well at the experimental stage, they invest hard and fast, through acquisition and/or expanding the operation rapidly.

I’m looking at some tidbits where they’re mentioning employee-internal health services, basically clinics with doctors and such.

It seems to me this is a classic R&amp;D effort inside a controlled environment. If they find they have a special sauce that could work in the marketplace, I would imagine there is going to be an announcement at one point where they’ll position a new Amazon product (whatever it’s going to be branded as, but I wouldn’t bat an eyelash if it was simply Amazon Health).

It’s an enormously profitable industry, it’s very hard to make inroads without serious capital and lobbying capacity, and Amazon has both. The incumbents have for the most part a pretty lousy customer experience, and between the software, the retail, and policy influence experience, I’d wager there is some serious potential. Add to this the currently heightened awareness about health care facilities and services.

I believe there is a 2 year time frame before there would be a significant announcement that would essentially put PPOs and HMOs on notice and make them sweat. There are plenty of successful boutique providers, small local hospitals, specialty clinics, a handful of franchises, but they’re all small scale. Acquiring a business that has the right real estate, and then implementing a health services model that allows people to get most ambulatory treatments without the enormous hassle, admin overhead, and time.... seems like a solid proposition in my book.

&gt;  
&gt;The success by activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 in getting at least two candidates on Exxon's board marks a big loss for the largest U.S. oil company, which incurred a $20 billion-plus loss in 2020 and has been slower to embrace lower-carbon investments than its global rivals. Exxon had sought to stave off investors aiming to reshape the board to better align the company with global moves to combat climate change.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two of Engine No. 1's board nominees, Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala, were elected to Exxon's board, with counting continuing.  
&gt;  
&gt;The dissident shareholder group led by Engine No. 1 put up a slate of four nominees to the 12-member Exxon board of directors at the shareholder meeting in the first big boardroom contest at an oil major that makes climate change the central issue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Exxon has lagged other oil majors in its response to climate change concerns, forecasting many more years of oil and gas demand growth and doubling down on investments to boost its output - in contrast to global rivals that have scaled back fossil fuel investments.  
&gt;  
&gt;That approach boosted the company's debt load by billions of dollars in recent years, leading to a record $22 billion loss in 2020 after years of underperformance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Governments and companies have moved to reduce emissions from fossil fuels that are warming the planet, and investors led by Engine No. 1 have said the changing world meant that CEO Darren Woods needed to make big changes to ensure Exxon's future value to investors.  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's a huge deal. It shows not just that there is more seriousness apparent in the thinking among investors about climate change, it's a rebuff of the whole attitude of the Exxon board,"" said Ric Marshall, executive director of ESG Research at MSCI.  
&gt;  
&gt;Woods had argued that Exxon's board understood the company's complexity and that Exxon supports a path toward carbon reductions in the Paris accord, referring to the international agreement aimed at combating climate change.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, in another signal of investor dissatisfaction with the company's approach to climate change, shareholders also approved measures calling on Exxon to provide more information on its climate and grassroots lobbying efforts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Engine No. 1 successfully rallied support from institutional investors and shareholder advisory firms upset with Irving, Texas-based Exxon for its weak financial performance in recent years. It has just a $50 million stake in Exxon, which carries a market value of nearly $250 billion.  
&gt;  
&gt;BlackRock Inc [**(BLK.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/BLK.N), Exxon’s second-largest shareholder, [**joined the dissidents**](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-blackrock-backs-three-director-nominees-challenging-exxons-board-2021-05-25/), as it will support three of Engine No. 1′s nominees, Reuters reported on Tuesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Exxon had fought to keep climate activists at bay, spending tens of millions of dollars on a high-profile PR campaign, agreeing to publish more details of its emissions and coming out in support of carbon reduction. Activists have said it is too little, too late, and that Exxon needs a less reactive strategy.  
&gt;  
&gt;""This proxy fight reflects this broad change in how our political leaders, our business leaders and our fellow shareholders are stepping up and taking these immense risks seriously,"" New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The state's pension fund in April said it backed Engine No. 1's slate.  
&gt;  
&gt;Exxon shares were up 0.9% in Wednesday trading, rising modestly after the announcement. The stock has lagged its peers over the last five years.

Could it be that Tesla expectations of dominance are subtracting from the expected returns of these car companies? I am looking at Toyota for example, who were the early leaders in electric tech and are now focusing on a large new range of ev’s. Could TM be a great buy if I think they will catch up on the ev tech?

Lastly, with the expected switch to greener tech, any thoughts on silver? I visit r/wallstreetsilver a lot and they have me convinced that the price will explode, but I would love other investors opinions. Reasons for silver: 
Decreased supply: mined silver per year has been decreasing and it is very difficult to find silver mines (most silver is a by product from other mines). 
Increased demand: Green tech (eg solar panels and electric cars). Also increased investor focus (silver squeeze movement plus it is a traditional inflation hedge)
Silver has got a bad name due to some etfs like SLV not being backed by physical silver, but PSLV is legit (or I prefer buying it from my local coin store and keeping it in my possession)

Edit: My real question probably should be worded as: if Tesla is a bubble and they won’t take over everything, is this an opportunity for other car manufacturers.

For example, let’s use $STEM. Institutional ownership is at 11% and institutional transactions is at -52.31%. I understand that institutions own 11% of the shares. Does the institutional transactions number of -52.31% reflect institutions selling 52.31% of their shares (or total shares?) over a set period of time? I.e., “52.31% decrease in shares owned over the last week”, or “over the last 24 hours”, etc? I can’t help but feel like I misunderstand the metric for that one.

Related question: Any idea how often these values are updated? Of course some of the numbers are essentially real-time, but I’d imagine this value (inst. own./trans.) requires some reporting/tabulating.

For example, just 2 weeks ago, $STEM had 75.2% institutional ownership (with 10% inst. transactions), and it has dropped significantly (down to 11% ownership/-52.31% transactions). Depending on how often this metric is updated, I’m wondering if this might mean investors knew it was going to drop over the past few weeks, or indicate someone knows something negative is about to happen with the company.

1621903634.0|0.0|t3_nkcyw3|27.0|" **Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor. What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks. They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants. A little complicated, but hope you follow. Exact wording from the agreement: ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out (x) 100 = $153 **+**
2. $1.00 equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

# What to expect next

The issue of greenhouse gas emissions will continue to concern regulators in Europe and around the world. It will also lead to additional laws and regulations that will affect companies, particularly in the fields of energy, industry and manufacturing, and aviation.

[On May 24–25, the European Council will convene for a special meeting](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2021/05/24-25/) to discuss the issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and provide further guidance on the issue. It is likely that the meeting will have an impact on the price of carbon.

[Analysts disagree about the rate of growth in the price of carbon](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/why-europes-carbon-market-is-experiencing-a-boom-like-never-before.html), Some claim it will continue to climb throughout the year to levels of over 100 euros per tonne, and some claim it will stabilize at around 40 in the coming year but will grow slowly until it at least doubles by the end of the decade.

It is worth following the reports and new regulations from government bodies in Europe and around the world, and pay attention to any new regulation that will directly affect Carbon activity and price.

As a result of the jump in the price of carbon, it is likely that we will see changes in companies that produce gas emissions. Especially from the energy-production, and aviation sectors, as well as the growth of companies that offer greener solutions.

[In addition, last year, China, too, committed ](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/china-considers-going-carbon-neutral-peaking-emissions/)to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and will reach Net-Zero Emissions by 2060.

And furthermore ""inflation is now again the biggest risk for markets,"" as initially identified by 35% of the survey's 194 respondents who manage a combined $592 billion worth of assets. But if investors are broadly concerned about inflation, it suggests stock prices are likely already reflecting these risks and investors have discounted, or priced in, inflation risk into the markets. While it may not be a perfect analog, it's worth considering what happened during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. 

On March 17, 2020, BofA's Global Fund Manager Survey identified ""Coronavirus"" as its biggest tail risk, and it remained on the top fo the list for the next 10 months as data consistently and persistently reflected an economy in a state of emergency. But the S&amp;P 500 prices bottomed on March 23, 2020. 

In other words, the market had priced in the coronavirus recession and discounted the pandemic's worst financial impacts by mid-March, but this risk still remained the consensus worry among investors for another year. 

The threat of inflation is the most known risk in the markets right now. And so investors should consider the likelihood that the downside of inflation has been priced in.

""Unlike recent cycles, we acknowledge that inflation tail-risk is higher and that inflation data could get hotter before normalizing,"" JPMorgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said. ""This outcome, at the same time, is getting increasingly priced-in as essentially every investor we have spoken to in recent weeks is well aware of this backdrop.""

According to Google, search interest in ""inflation"" is at an all-time high. The University of Michigan's recent survey of consumers revealed sentiment got dinged in May due to unusually elevated concerns about inflation in the years to come.

On the corporate side, a record number of S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) companies have discussed ""inflation"" on earnings calls as executives just can't stop talking about higher costs.

Whether or not inflation actually becomes a major problem for the economy will only be known in hindsight.

Analyst Will Nance initiated coverage of the cryptocurrency exchange on Monday with a buy rating, saying in a note to clients that Coinbase is the best way to gain exposure to cryptocurrency ecosystems.

Coinbase went public through a direct listing on April 14 and, after an initial pop, its shares have struggled. The stock rose above $400 during that first day of trading, but on Friday closed near $224.

* Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance initiates coverage of Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) with a Buy rating partly on its business model that ""thrives on elevated cryptocurrency volatility.""
* That volatility has been on display in recent weeks as seen in crypto swings as evidenced in bitcoin's wild ride. This morning bitcoin rises to $37.6K but had dropped as low as $31.1K on Sunday.
* COIN stock rises 3.0% in premarket trading.
* Sets price target at $306; implies a 36% upside potential for stock based on Friday's closing price of $224.35.
* Nance also likes COIN's leverage to an ecosystem with strong growth driven by increasing adoption of digital currencies, its consumer platform with strong customer acquisition trends and rapidly growing institutional business, and its opportunities to add additional features and capabilities.
* Though the continued success or failure of crypto as an asset class will ultimately determine COIN's future, ""we believe COIN represents a blue-chip way through with to invest in the development of the ecosystem,"" the analyst writes.
* Points to COIN's careful approach to regulatory compliance, crypto-native technology stack, and role as an innovation hub for new crypto endeavors.
* Nance's Buy rating is more optimistic than the average SA Author's rating of Neutral (6 Bullish, 5 Neutral, 2 Bearish) and aligns with the average Wall Street rating of Bullish (6 Very Bullish, 1 Bullish, 4 Neutral).
* Last week, Coinbase snagged an Outperform rating at Wedbush helped by its ""first mover"" advantage.

As far as I can tell, the only reason it hasn't risen is because European nations have had a much more difficult time recovering travel-wise.

In my search, I found a company called Arbor, which is a REIT with a very juicy dividend yield (7.86%). Usually, dividend yields this high are when the company stock falls due to a bad future outlook, and it's expected that the company might have to cut its dividends soon, but that's not the case here — $ABR has been steadily growing for years. 

I tried to read a bit more about this company, but I feel like I'm lacking the knowledge to understand what's it doing to be growing so much. It's a REIT that specializes in mortgages, but I thought this kind of stuff got less popular after 2008? Is it super risky?

Have you ever heard of the Norwegian State Fund?  No?  Not only is it the largest fund in the world, but it is also considered one of the most cleverly managed.  He has built a huge fortune from virtually nothing through constant, low-risk investing.  His strategy has proven itself over various market cycles and can certainly be a blueprint for private investors.  But how exactly did this come about and what has the fund done right in the past?

The story began in the 1960s when oil was first found off the coast of Norway.  From the beginning, Norwegian politicians made it important that the inhabitants benefit from the wealth of raw materials: not only through sovereignty over mineral resources, but also through jobs.  The oil industry paid really well and pulled the wages of other industries with it.  In the medium term, this meant that inflation rose.

With the first oil price shock, the demand for Norwegian crude oil also fell.  Economic growth collapsed.  At the same time, the amount of foreign currency debt rose.

Norwegian politicians stuck to their long-term perspective.  They no longer wanted to make the Norwegian economy so dependent on oil and they also wanted to avoid the high export surpluses that had been common up until then, because that affected exchange rates and inflation.  That is why they came up with the idea of ​​completely investing the excess payments from oil exports abroad.  Quasi: Oil leaves the country, but the money received for it does not enter the Norwegian economic cycle.

The so-called oil fund came into being in the mid-1990s.  In this state-managed investment fund, the income from Norway's crude oil and natural gas sales is invested, all of the income, not just part of it.  The oil fund invests worldwide, long-term and according to ethical principles.  His goal is to provide for the financial future of all Norwegian residents if the income from oil and gas no longer flows at some point.

While private investors often act from the gut, the oil fund has clear rules and guidelines.  His goal is to invest the money optimally in the long term from a risk-return perspective.  Because the fund is responsible for the financial future of many generations to come.  Anyone can view the investments and results of the oil fund on the Internet at any time.  So there is great transparency.

The Norwegian Oil Fund is a low-risk, profitable investment in the future and can therefore serve as a role model for private investors.

Since 1998 the oil fund has grown to the equivalent of over one trillion euros.  This corresponds to a value of around 190,000 euros per inhabitant.

It's all about the right mix:

Since 1998, the oil fund has achieved an average gross return of a good six percent per year before costs, inflation and taxes.  The income fluctuates depending on the stock market situation: In some years there is even a minus, in others double-digit returns are recorded.  The fund invests very successfully in the long term.  But how exactly does it work?

The steady returns are possible because the oil fund diversifies its investments across different asset classes and across different industries and regions.

The three asset classes in which the oil fund invests are stocks, bonds and real estate.  Stocks fluctuate more than bonds, so they are riskier.  In return, they generate better returns.  Since the oil fund thinks long-term, it overweight equities, currently at around 70 percent.  Real estate is only a small addition.  The rest goes into bonds.  According to modern portfolio theory, those responsible expect the best risk-return ratio from this.  The proportion of stocks in relation to bonds and real estate is regularly checked and adjusted to the target - also known as rebalancing.

For equity investments, the oil fund is based on the FTSE Global All Cap.  This is a stock index that contains around 8,000 stocks from large, medium and small companies around the world.  However, the oil fund deviates somewhat: European stocks, for example, are overweight and US stocks are underweight.  In addition to individual regions, individual industries can also be overweighted or underweighted.  There is also a black list of companies that are not invested in for ethical reasons.  These include, for example, energy suppliers such as Tata Power, companies that partially or exclusively manufacture armaments such as Lockheed Martin, Honeywell International, Airbus, Boeing, or tobacco companies.

When it comes to bond investments, the oil fund has so far invested seventy percent in government bonds and thirty percent in corporate bonds.  However, since a company's stocks and bonds are often closely linked, it was recently decided to only invest in government bonds.

The Norwegian oil fund is therefore based on an optimized mix of asset classes: around two thirds of it consists of stocks, one third of bonds, and some real estate is also mixed in.

The compound interest effect increases the fund's return.  The longer the investment horizon, the more it exploits its advantages.  In the case of the oil fund, income from interest and dividends is now higher than the new deposits.

A look at the oil fund's portfolio:

You've just heard that the oil fund invests in stocks, bonds and real estate.

Let's start with the equity investments.  At the end of 2019, around 71 percent of the fund's assets were invested in stocks.  The focus is on North America, followed by Europe.  Africa brings up the rear with less than one percent.

The focus of equity investments is therefore on large, developed economies.  But stocks from less developed emerging countries, the so-called emerging markets, are also included.  The equity quota here is 11 percent, because the emerging markets promise higher returns in the long term than the established countries, but the risk is also higher.  Smaller companies are also overweighted because, similar to emerging market stocks, they generate more returns on average.

At the end of 2019, around 26 percent of the fund's assets were invested in bonds.  A little more than half of them were government bonds.  Similar to stocks, bonds focus on North America and Europe.  But other countries and currencies are also mixed in, for example bonds in Japanese yen, Mexican peso or Brazilian real have been taken out.  The share of emerging markets is nine percent.

The remaining 43 percent are currently corporate bonds and covered bonds such as Pfandbriefe or similarly secured bonds.  However, as I said, the portfolio of corporate bonds is to be reduced in the future in favor of government bonds.

The creditworthiness, i.e. the creditworthiness of the bond debtors, is consistently high: only two percent of the bonds fall into the speculative area.

The third asset class that the oil fund invests in is real estate.  At the end of 2019, the volume invested in real estate was just under three percent.  Here the fund concentrates on office, logistics and retail properties in top cities such as New York, London, Paris and Munich.

The five principles of the Norwegian investment strategy:

The fund managers of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund have not come up with a magic formula, but instead follow a series of investment guidelines, guidelines and rules.  We have put together for you the five most important principles of the Norwegian investment strategy.

First, there is the principle of passivity: invest passively and close to the index, which saves time and money.  The less fees you pay, the more income is left for you.

Second, there is diversification: the more you spread your wealth across different asset classes, the lower your risk of loss.  So take some time at the beginning to plan your strategy.  With the right mix of stocks, bonds and possibly real estate, choose an investment mix that suits your available assets and risk appetite.  Diversify within these asset classes according to geographic aspects.  Invest in both developed and developing countries, and by company size.  Overweight both emerging market stocks and smaller company stocks.  This way you can take advantage of opportunities and at the same time distribute your risk better.  About once a year you should restore your target quotas, i.e. rebalance.

Thirdly, we have the long-term investment horizon: Those who invest long-term can take more risks and thus generate a higher return.  Even if you are already retired, you should keep an equity stake.  Buy and hold, that is, buy and leave it alone, is more effective than trying to constantly chase after new trends.

Fourth, you should pay attention to consistency: what oil is to Norway, is your labor to you.  Invest a fixed amount every month, depending on your income, not the market situation.  If you earn more, increase your standing order.  This is also a better way of offsetting inflation.

And fifth, ethics also count: Pay attention to ethically correct, sustainable investments.  Violations of human rights, heavy pollution, arms manufacture, tobacco products or serious corruption are taboo for the oil fund.  For your private consumption, you can go a step further and only buy from companies that manufacture their goods ethically.

In short: invest long-term, regularly, sustainably, also diversified and index-based, and overweight shares of small companies and emerging markets as a return boost.

Build your personal future fund: The three levers for building private wealth

Now that we have taken a close look at the Norwegian oil fund, let's take a very practical look at how you as a private investor can implement the Norwegian strategy.  We take care of the three sub-areas stocks, bonds and real estate in turn.  But first, a few basic ideas about investing.

As already mentioned, there will be around 190,000 euros in the fund for every Norwegian in 2021.  If you want to save such a sum, there are various adjusting screws.

First of all, there is your investment horizon.  Following the Norwegian model, it should be an investment period of at least ten to fifteen years.  Even if you are about to retire, that doesn't mean that you need your money in one fell swoop.  You can pay out a monthly amount from your future fund instead of saving it further, a kind of private supplementary pension.

The second adjustment screw is your monthly savings rate.  How Much Money Can You Save?  Can you reduce fixed costs, do without what is superfluous or consume more consciously in order to invest this money in your future fund?  Do you already have securities or reserves in a call money or savings account?  You can also invest this money in your future fund.  If you earn more, you should increase the savings rate, at least by the rate of inflation.  Conversely, if you become unemployed, for example, you can lower your savings rate.

The third adjustment screw, the return, can only be influenced indirectly, namely through your asset class mix.  In addition to your personal perception of risk, it also depends on your investment horizon.  As a rule of thumb, subtract your age from 100, the sum corresponds to the share quota.  While as a thirty-year-old you invest seventy percent of your money in stocks, as a seventy-year-old you lower your risk with an equity ratio of thirty percent.  Of course, this also reduces the return.

The result, your saved wealth, results from the interaction of these three levers: investment horizon, monthly savings rate and return.

If you want to reach a certain amount, then it is important to start as early as possible.  This is also due to the compound interest effect.  The higher your return and the longer your investment horizon, the less you have to invest monthly.


Build your personal future fund: bonds

Now let's get into the construction kit of your personal future fund.  Our first pillar is bonds.  What can we learn from the Norwegians here?

Although the oil fund also invests worldwide in bonds, we limit ourselves to the most important currencies.  Because of their lower yield, currency fluctuations have a greater impact on bonds.  However, this is not a problem insofar as countries outside the eurozone also issue bonds in euros.

The prices of bonds also fluctuate, depending on the creditworthiness of the issuer, the remaining term and the interest rate level.  The oil fund tries to minimize this risk by only investing in government bonds with a maximum term of ten years.

An ETF savings plan is particularly useful if you are not yet very familiar with the capital market or if you cannot invest a lot of money.  ETFs, short for Exchange Traded Funds, are so-called index funds.  They replicate an index one to one;  this passive structure lowers costs, which in turn increases your return on investment.  You will remember: The oil fund also invests in line with the index.

For a bond quota similar to the Norwegian model, you should have a single ETF with a remaining term of no more than ten years that invests in government bonds that are denominated in euros.  You can find corresponding products on the website justetf.com.  For example the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 7-10 Year Euro Government Bond ETF (ISIN IE00BYSZ5Z42).  Of course, you can also take ETFs with other maturities or other country focuses outside the euro zone.  Take a close look at the countries and maturities in which the ETF invests.  You can find this information, for example, on finance portals or on the websites of the providers.  The names alone do not always allow conclusions to be drawn about the content.

When it comes to sustainability, bond ETFs don't have much to offer at the moment.  So far there are only a few so-called green bonds.  You could, for example, buy a German government bond directly or a single green bond.  Rebalancing, i.e. aligning with your originally planned mix of assets, is usually easier with ETFs.

For your first fund pillar, the following applies: Government bonds that are denominated in euros and can be spread around the world contribute to stability.

So if you like it simple, you can tick off the bond issue with a single ETF.  It's more complicated with stocks.  For this, the topic of sustainability comes into play more strongly.

Build your personal future fund: stocks

So what can we learn from the Norwegians about stocks?  ETFs are also recommended here, with a maximum of twelve different ones.  The amounts per ETF should not be too small, otherwise this can increase the transaction costs.

The Norwegian Oil Fund invests worldwide, and that is what you should aim for for your equity exposure.  The following breakdown is recommended: 80 percent of industrialized market shares, 80 percent of which in large caps and 20 percent in small caps.  The 80 percent share of industrialized countries is distributed geographically as follows: 44 percent in North America, 44 percent in Europe and 12 percent in Asia and Oceania.  The remaining 20 percent of the equity stake is invested in emerging markets.  However, no further distinction is made here according to company size or region, as the diversification would otherwise be too confusing.

Are you still looking through  With a 70 percent equity component, this means, for example: 28 percent shares large caps North America, 28 percent shares large caps Europe, 8 percent shares large caps Asia and Oceania, 7 percent shares small caps North America, 7 percent shares small caps Europe, 2 percent shares  Small caps Asia and Oceania, 20 percent equities in emerging markets.  With a different share of shares, you can calculate the odds yourself using the above specifications.

For equity ETFs, you should prefer replicating over synthetic ones.  Replicating ETFs actually buy the share packages that are available in the fund, weighted according to the index, while synthetic ETFs artificially replicate the index via swap transactions.

On justetf.com you can filter funds by country, company size and all sorts of other criteria in order to replicate your future fund based on the Norwegian model.  You are of course flexible with the number of ETFs, but with seven you can map the Norwegian portfolio quite well.  If you are still at the very beginning of your future fund, you can first approach the optimal composition with fewer ETFs.  For industrialized countries, for example, you could use the UBS MSCI World SRI (ISIN LU0629459743) and for emerging markets the iShares MSCI EM SRI (ISIN IE00BYVJRP78).

In the two ETFs mentioned, ethical and moral aspects are taken into account, as you can usually see from the abbreviations SRI for socially responsible investment or ESG for environmental social governance.  Sometimes the providers work with negative lists, sometimes they pursue a best-in-class approach.  The latter means that they only invest in the most exemplary companies in an industry, such as the oil giant Total.  The approaches are not yet perfect, but they are still an important step towards sustainable investing.

Globally diversified stocks should make up the main part of your future fund; their higher returns mean that currency fluctuations are less significant in the long term.

We have now ticked off the two most important asset classes, stocks and bonds.  The question of adding real estate remains.

Build your personal future fund: real estate

The third pillar makes it a little more difficult for us.  That is why we do not start with the question of how, but start much more fundamentally with the question: real estate, yes or no?

Why?  Well, the oil fund invests a maximum of seven percent of its assets in directly held commercial real estate in prime locations.  As a private investor, you can forget that.  Even if you want to implement the real estate quota in the form of owner-occupied residential property, you would have to be a multiple millionaire to catch up with the oil fund.

Basically, you should clarify for yourself whether you want to have a property you use yourself or not.  If your answer is yes, forget about the strategic real estate quota.  Just be aware that the money you put into a property cannot be invested in your future fund at the same time.  Think not only of possible increases in the value of your property, but also of ancillary purchase costs, maintenance costs and mortgage interest.  You will only know afterwards what you will use to generate a better return, the property or your future fund.

Alternatively, you can invest smaller amounts in real estate using real estate ETFs or REITs.  The latter is short for Real Estate Investment Trust, which are public companies that earn their money with real estate.  The specialty of REITs is that they distribute a large part of their profits.  As with other investments, you should reinvest this income in order to use the compound interest effect for you.  An example of a real estate ETF with a focus on “industrialized countries” is the iShares Developed Markets Property Yield ETF (ISIN IE00B1FZS350).

To put it in a nutshell: real estate is immobile.  Therefore, think carefully about whether and in what form real estate should be part of your future fund.

Okay, did you understand?  Then get started: Open an online account, set up a savings plan that corresponds to your desired risk-return mix, and make sure to rebalance at least once a year.  Then you too can get rich like Norway.


Too long, didn’t read:

Let's sum it up again: The Norwegian Oil Fund is investing its money in the future.  It only uses stocks, bonds and, to a small extent, real estate.  Its success is based on an optimal risk-return mix, low costs, a long-term perspective and the consideration of sustainability.  The fund is completely transparent: both its strategy and its individual investments can be viewed on the Internet.

This is exactly what you can take advantage of as a private investor.  In order to put together your personal future fund based on the Norwegian model, first decide on the mix of assets that is right for you.  Then find suitable ETFs and set up a monthly savings plan.  With a long-term investment horizon and annual rebalancing, your returns should ultimately be as successful as Norway’s oil."|investing|Invest like the Norwegian Oil Fund|798.0|0.93

Disclosure I do not own any shares. 

I came across LOTZ in a stock screener as I had set a price target of $5 and noticed it got close to it.  To keep with the discipline of doing more research upon researching the 1st price target I dug deeper and did the following model.  

Summary
Carlotz is really a lead-gen tech business to help rental fleets and consumers sell directly to retail  vs. going through the auction process.  They eliminate the extra step and fees that is entailed in auction houses.  The company also allows consumers to sell their cars to other consumers with Carlotz being the ""broker"" that makes the process easy for both parties. 
The revenues are: flat fee from buyer, fee from seller (used to inspect, clean car and take pics), financing and insurance upsells and lease income.  

However, the company reports the total car sale as the revenue which is a bit funky but legal.  This is why the GROSS margins are 10% to 12%, if the Gross Margins were the ""revenues"" the company would only show a revenue of $35 million for 2021 vs. $350 million, kinda hard to sell a SPAC at a $1.4 billion valuation when the revenues are $35 but with eventual ""80% EBITDA margins"". 

I ran a 10 year model and do believe the company can become profitable by 2023 unless they keep expanding more aggressively than modeled but by 2024 they can grow organically using cash flow.  

I think the stock is a buy at $4 since at this price we have some downside protection of the cash on the balance sheet of around $2 and at that price you are only paying a 1x enterprise value to multiple multiple which is on the low side compared to historical of Carvana, KAR and others. 

Would I want to own this business forever?  No,  but I think it can go from $4 to $10 to $15 pretty quickly if the GROSS margins go to 13% to 15% as they originally projected in their investor presentation, however in my 10 year model I do not see 15% margins until 2030z Management has missed guidance on revenues for 2021 and margins and the street doubts they can meet their numbers for this year.  This is the risk and why I think it may trade lower in the short-term.  

2021 rev 330mm and 1x ev would be $4 and 2x ev is $8

2022 rev is 850mm and 1x ev is $8 and 2x would be $16

2023 rev would be $1.4 billion and 1x ev would be $12 and at 2x ev would be $24

The execution risk is will they be able to meet these revenue targets and go from the current 10% gross margins to the 13% they said they would be able to do on the Octoeber 2020 investor deck. 

It could eventually become a takeover target as we have now 5 to 10 companies in this space and companies are always looking for growth. 

Anyway interested to hear your thoughts on this. I can definitely go more granular into the business model but for simplicity sake kept it short.

Looking forward to your comments!"|investing|$LOTZ is this bottom for Carlotz? Or do we go lower? I think worth $4 to $24 over a few years.|5.0|0.62

This is especially true in states like NY where restrictions are tighter than Miami. 

As the CDC loosens fask mask restrictions for vaccinated people, I’m seeing a ton of young people outside (maskless) in strict areas like NYC. The streets look like a Miami Spring Break - a whole gathering of young people in the streets in large numbers and no masks to be found. 

The big takeaway, however, is that masks are strictly enforced inside all establishments. Using restaurants as an example, customers must wear masks when they enter/exit and move around, but they are not required to wear masks when they eat. Most importantly, business employees MUST wear masks at all times, and will therefore go through masks at a much quicker pace. The business itself will have to provide PPE for their employees, leading me to conclude the future of COVID era PPE is B2B (in the US / EU and countries with access to vaccinations). 

What company is best situated to provide business with direct PPE supply? OPTEC International (OPTI) acquired WeShield - a B2B PPE supplier, with clients from Old Navy to Carl’s Jr. What led me to OPTEC and WeShield however, is an [article ](https://www.bkreader.com/2021/04/14/nyc-restaurants-gifted-free-ppe-through-new-partnership/)I found about their PPE donations to NYC restaurants through a partnership with the NYC Hospitality Alliance. It turns out the WeShield is run by fellow restaurant owners turned medical suppliers. In the article, a WeShield spokesperson said that the PPE cost of a restaurant is about $5-10 per employee, per day. 

The article also acknowledged that alleviating PPE costs for independent restaurants is what sparked their donation campaign. But without donations, $5-10 per employee per day really adds up and leaves us with a still emerging market of PPE buyers. Not just restaurants but all brick and mortar businesses are new customers in a space that was mostly used by healthcare organizations.

It will be interesting to see how the divide for public vs commercial PPE restrictions grows and which sectors maintain their status as large quantity PPE purchasers. For now, restaurants and retail locations have no plans on changing their PPE policies which leaves a niche market for suppliers like OPTEC."|investing|Is supplying PPE directly to business the way forward for PPE providers in the US, EU?|165.0|0.85
1621604216.0|0.0|t3_nhspuq|11.0|"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/oatly-is-said-to-price-ipo-at-top-of-range-with-markets-slumping

Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, jumped in its debut after pricing its initial public offering at the top of a marketed range.

Shares opened Thursday at $22.12 in New York, a 30% jump from their $17 IPO price. The company and its investors sold more than 84 million American depositary shares on Wednesday, raising more than $1.4 billion. The Swedish company had offered the shares for $15 to $17 each.

Oatly’s shares, which rose as much as 34%, were up 29% to $21.95 at 1:39 p.m., giving the company a market value of about $13 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

In July, it secured $200 million in new capital from investors led by Blackstone Group Inc. The group also included celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, as well as Starbucks Corp. founder Howard Schultz. The company was valued at about $2 billion in that round.


Both Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, and Schultz also participated in the IPO, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A representative for Oatly declined to comment. Roc Nation and Schultz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat Inc., whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019.

Oatly’s biggest obstacle might be its own popularity. Since its entrance into the U.S. market in 2017, finding Oatly in coffee shops and supermarkets has become something of a treasure hunt for shoppers.

The company opened a $15 million Millville, New Jersey, plant in 2019 to help meet the growing demand, but even now, shortages are frequent, as Covid-related delays have kept a planned second U.S. production from coming online.

In March, supermarkets across the U.S. -- and even its big new customer Starbucks -- reported trouble procuring orders.

While the current shortage won’t end overnight, Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson sounded an optimistic note.

Fulfilling Orders
“This year, we will bring on board new capacity every single quarter,” he said in an interview ahead of the first trade. The company is expanding its Netherlands plant, putting out commercial products from its Utah plant, and is doing test runs in Singapore, where the factory will be “up and running” in the second quarter, he said.

For now, Oatly is only filling 70% of orders in its key markets, so it is “not really” taking on new customers, Petersson said, adding that the gap is between supply and orders, not supply and demand. “First we will close the gaps, then expand with new retail partners,” he added.

Oatly was started in 1994 by brothers Rickard and Bjorn Oste. Using technology based on research from Sweden’s Lund University, the company turns fiber-rich oats into liquid food.

Oatly’s offering was led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol OTLY."|investing|Oatly Jumps in Debut After Raising $1.4 Billion in IPO|59.0|0.86

&gt;Core CPI jumped to 3.0 percent year-over-year in April, the fastest pace since 1996. While the base effect from low readings in April 2020 was widely expected by markets, the monthly pace of inflation also rose notably. Core CPI increased 0.92 percent from March to April, the largest monthly gain since 1981.

&gt;The market seems to think this may be the start of an enduring trend of higher inflation, given record fiscal stimulus, ultra-easy Federal Reserve (Fed) accommodation, and ongoing supply bottlenecks. But a closer look at the data suggests that this spike in prices is a one-time adjustment as the economy reopens.

&gt;Spooked bond investors pulled forward Fed rate hike expectations after the CPI release, despite the Fed repeatedly emphasizing that they view this reopening-induced rise in prices as transitory. Investors should believe the Fed when they say they will look through this temporary inflation noise and fade the bond selloff.

&gt;The month-to-month gains in the core CPI were largely driven by a few small categories related to economic reopening and temporary pandemic-induced shortages. 54 of the 92 basis point increase came from used cars, rental cars, airfares, and hotels, despite these categories having a weight of just 5 percent in the core CPI basket. The contribution was so large because the monthly price increases were so huge (e.g. 10 percent gain in used car prices). These increases are unlikely to be sustained beyond the next few months, especially once prices in depressed categories recover back to the pre-COVID trend.

&gt;To the Fed, what matters is the trend in the larger, more durable inflation categories that influence the longer-term inflation outlook. In those categories, sequential inflation was much more muted: rents (including owners’ equivalent rent) and healthcare services contributed just 8 basis points to the monthly gain, despite making up 49 percent of the core CPI index. The Fed is more focused on the chart below than the chart above—and the bond market should be too.

Drone Delivery Canada Corp. (TSXV: FLT; OTC QX: TAKOF; Frankfurt:  A2AMGZ or ABB.F) (the “Company” or “DDC”) is pleased to announce that, with the assistance of its sales agent Air Canada  (TSX: AC), it has been selected by the University of British Columbia (“UBC”) to deploy DDC’s patented drone delivery solution at the Stellat’en First Nation, for UBC’s “Remote Communities Drone Transport Initiative” program.

 

The project will enable defined-route deliveries utilizing DDC’s Sparrow drone and its DroneSpot® takeoff and landing zones as well as additional drone flight infrastructure as required.  The solution will be used to transport a variety of cargo for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation, located in the Fraser Lake area of Central Northern British Columbia, Canada.

 

DDC and UBC will work towards finalizing a definitive agreement shortly.  DDC is expected to commence deployment of site infrastructure summer of 2021 and expects to begin providing drone delivery services under the agreement in the second half of 2021. The drone project term is expected to be 12 months. This deployment will be DDC’s fourth First Nations project and its first in British Columbia.

 

All operations will be conducted in accordance with appropriate Canadian regulations. Flights will be remotely monitored by DDC from its Operations Control Centre located in Vaughan, Ontario.

 

“We look forward to working with Drone Delivery Canada and all partners on this project for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation.  Many First Nations communities in B.C. are on lockdown to reduce transmission of COVID-19, which has exacerbated inequitable access to health care supplies and services, ranging from personal protective equipment and medications to laboratory services such as COVID-19 testing and diagnostics for other medical conditions,” said Dr. Michael Allard, Vice-Dean, Health Engagement &amp; Partnerships, UBC.

 

“Based on the isolated location of our community and the needs of our residents, drone transport may enhance our access to COVID-19 testing and medication without traveling and endangering other members of our community,” said Chief Robert Michell of the Stellat’en First Nation, located about 100 kilometres west of Prince George. “The futuristic potential of this initiative is exciting. With drone technology, there is so much you can do.”

 

“We are pleased that UBC has chosen Drone Delivery Canada as part of their ‘Remote Communities Drone Transportation Initiative’ at the Stellat’en First Nation. The UBC Faculty of Medicine is a recognized global leader and we applaud their initiative to embrace drone delivery to benefit First Nations communities. As an award-winning global leader, DDC is pleased with our continued business successes in the drone delivery industry,” said Michael Zahra, President &amp; CEO of DDC."|investing|Drone Delivery Canada selected by UBC for remote communities delivery initiative|37.0|0.82

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto.

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin).
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic. You would think that if the US dollar was ***actually*** debasing, we would get more than a 5% drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here.

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin. Just trying to debunk some of the very obviously incorrect narratives that have been sold to the public over the years."|investing|Can we please throw out the idea that Bitcoin is an asset that protects against inflation?|3197.0|0.83

What's Tether?

USDT is a ""stablecoin"" -- a cryptocurrency whose price is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar -- managed by a company called tether.

Initially tether said they enforced the peg by having each USDT be backed by a USD in a bank account. Then tether ran into all sorts of hilarious hijinks over the years, many of which we only found out because they [were made public in NYAG litigation](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf), including:

* Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)
* Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.
* Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.
* Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)
* Finding the last bank on earth, [Deltec Bank from Bahamas](https://www.deltecbank.com/) willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to [willingly deals with drug cartels](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-dirty-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine/). No bank wants tether as a client.

Just read section 2 and 3 of the NYAG settlement. It's a blast. The best recap on the tether saga is by [Amy Castor](https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/), but [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/) also has a good write up. Note that Patrick's piece is quaint now -- it was written back in 2019 when tether's balance sheet was $2B. Tether now has over [$58B on their balance sheet](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.28.53-PM-1024x585.png)

As far as we know, there was no point in history at which USDT in circulation were backed 1-to-1 by USD in a bank account. At this point, they stopped even pretending -- each tether in circulation is backed by... [tether's ""reserves"".](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reserves.gif)

The ""Reserves""

For a long time, tether's ""reserves"" were a mystery. As found in the NYAG investigation, tether likely never had a dollar in a bank account for each USDT, at any point, ever. They're now forced to reveal the makeup in May 2021 as per the NYAG settlement. Tether found a 5-person accounting firm in the Cayman islands willing to do an [attestation](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tether-assurance-feb-2021.pdf), which states they have 0.36% more assets than liabilities.

In anticipation for their forced public disclosure, tether recently posted this [glorious pie chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/glorious_pie_chart-1024x769.png)

Which [has](https://protos.com/tether-pie-chart-usdt-dollar-pegged-crypto-stablecoin-dollar-value/) [prompted](https://bennettftomlin.com/2021/05/13/for-every-1-of-tether-there-are-0-03-in-cash/) [many](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tether-first-breakdown-shows-token-120000439.html) [more](https://www.ft.com/content/529eb4e6-796a-4e81-8064-5967bbe3b4d9) [questions](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/05/13/tether-publishes-two-pie-charts-of-its-reserves/). First, we can view the actual debt in this form, as [broken Intel Jackal](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piechart.png))

Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

Inconsistencies

Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, posted a [highly unusual blog post](https://stuarthoegner.medium.com/tether-is-setting-a-new-standard-for-transparency-and-responding-to-criticism-that-is-fc130e08319b) in which he claims this is good debt by any standard. This raises many inconsistencies, which are easy to see given the magnitude of the numbers at hand.

* Stuart claims they don't hold Treasury Bills because the interest rate is close to 0%. If they hold this risky debt as reserves because it pays higher interest, **why does tether only have 0.36% more assets than liabilities?** Either thether's management is looting the interest rates on the assets and leaving USDT holders with the debt's risk, or we're being lied to.
* With $20B in commercial paper at the time of the attestation, and 50% more USDT on the market since, tether presumably has **$30B in commercial paper** at time of writing. The [entire commercial paper market](https://sec.gov/files/primer-money-market-funds-commercial-paper-market.pdf) in the US is around $1T per year.

We're supposed to believe that **tether somehow holds 3% of the US commercial paper market** at time of writing, and that they *apparently bought 1% of the entire market in the last month alone*.

* The asset allocation strategy in the reserves seems to be [copied from](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal/status/1394562510070583296) an investment fund at tether's bank, Deltec. This investment fund apparently manages $425M, rather than $60B.
* If the reserves are such regular financial assets, how come respectable accounting firms won't even touch it for a simple attestation?

We know that some of the money used for USDT come from Chinese money laundering because a tether shareholder [was recently charged](https://protos.com/china-crypto-otc-king-zhao-dong-criminal-charges-court-docs-show/). But we see no mention of frozen accounts in the reserves. Moreover, this amounts to less than $0.5B, and the perpetrator was nicknamed the ""Chinese OTC King"" -- so even in the charitable case where USDT are fully backed by money laundering, this raises inconsistencies.

Reminder: non-USD reserves for a stablecoin are a problem

As noted by [Frances Coppola](https://www.coppolacomment.com/2021/05/tethers-smoke-and-mirrors.html), it's dangerous to guarantee to clients that something is worth $1 when your assets backing it are not dollars. The value of the USD changes very little. The value of crypto changes a lot.

If you want to enforce a market price of $1 for something backed by not-dollars, then the quantity of reserves needs to go up and down with the asset price changes. Otherwise, you'll eventually become insolvent, when asset prices become lower than what you bought them for.

Who are these loan to?

Tether has lost the privilege of the benefit of doubt a long time ago. Here is how tether's Ponzi scheme likely works:

* All their commercial debt is to the related exchanges (Binance, FTX, Bitfinex - see below) or their affiliated shell companies.
* Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates
* The affiliates use the new USDT to put market buy-orders for crypto, putting them on the new USDT on market
* Crypto goes up in value becaue of the new demand pressure. This overcollateralizes the affiliated loans, justifying more loans.
* Rinse, repeat.

We can track who new USDT go to directly by looking at their [TRON](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TKHuVq1oKVruCGLvqVexFs6dawKv6fQgFs/transfers), [ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5754284f345afc66a98fbb0a0afe71e0f007b949#tokentxns), [OMNI](https://omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) and [Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Q6XprfkF8RQQKoQVG33xT88H7wi8Uk1B1CC7YAs69Gi) blockchain addresses. By matching the blockchain addresses new USDT are sent to to known parties, we can track who are the ones sending [new USDT on the market:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether-to-exchanges-1024x530.png)

The counterparties are largely Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. The commercial paper is presumably to affiliated shell companies. I wouldn't put those companies debt at a dollar-to-dollar valuation; for instance [Binance is currently under investigation by the DOJ and IRS](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in).

But how does the $1 peg hold?

This is an easy one. [FTX happily admits to enforcing the dollar peg](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1348773044873949185) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.12.17-PM-861x1024.png))

You can easily enforce the dollar peg by wash-trading around the $1 price and arbitraging on exchanges who don't.

FTX don't even need to be complicit to the scheme for this to make financial sense: if FTX can get new USDT for $1 on an infinite loan margin from tether, it's perfectly sensible to buy USDT when it's below $1 and shortsell USDT when it's above.

The Mississippi bubble, 2021 style

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is conceptually simple. Money comes in from new investors buying, and the same money comes out to pay those cashing out. It would be a zero-sum ecosystem, except for the fact that miners have to pay their [bills in dollars](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_simple.png)

This is why ""bitcoin investors"" feel an immediate urge to tell everyone else to invest in bitcoin -- if no new money comes in, the financial structure eventually collapses under the miner's sell pressure.

Note how this is different than buying a company's stock. People buy and sell stocks on a stock exchange, but the companies independently have money coming in (from their clients). The stock of a profitable company is a positive-sum ecosystem. If somehow no one wants to buy the stock, a profitable company will be happy to buy it back itself.

When tether comes in with their scheme, they put demand pressure on BTC then add a supply constraint on BTC (also driving up the price!) by reducing the total supply of BTC to [hoard in their reserves](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_usdt.png)

Notice that even though bitcoin prices are higher, **no additional money entered the ecosystem** in the tether pump. Like a Ponzi scheme, we *cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price* using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and [someone has to pay for it.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/masterpiece.gif)

The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for [more overall than they're now worth.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether_insolvency_point.png)

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and **under**collateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, [no one picked it up for years](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.16.05-PM-1024x497.png)

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in [DeFi and total USDT](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/defirates-1024x512.png)

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k (now 38k). But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see **significant backflows** into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address [on Tron, for example](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/death-1024x567.png)

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Not from the copy paste: I want to add to this, on the day of Elon's initial tweet about Tesla not accepting bitcoin, there was a drastic spike of bitcoin coming into exchanges JUST PRIOR to the tweet. Was this Elon, someone he told, or just a lucky trade? Who knows. However, after the tweet there was a sudden move of 650 million tether (so $650m)  onto exchanges to BUY bitcoin as the price was collapsing and this stabilized the price. In my opinion tether is being used to inflate BTC but unlike the federal reserve tether cannot print $$$$. **Oh, and tether clearly states they do NOT guarantee any redemption of dollars to holders of tether.** IE they are not assured you can trade a tether for a dollar like other stable coins

&amp;#x200B;

1621369544.0|0.0|t3_nfl8th|20.0|"Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021)

Why do you care? Good question, automobile manufactures have gotten higher multiples (at least for a short time) based on producing, or moving closer to producing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and sometimes just by pretending they will change their name to emphasize Electrical terminology, and of course having a company named after the people who discovered how to make electricity work gets really high multiples (doesn’t work for utilities named after Edison though). Toyota has been reluctant to move into the BEV space, did this change? Will they rename themselves after Alessandro Volta? Let’s find out.

First, I really want to thank the modern world that can take spoken Japanese from multiple speakers and convert that into written English so cheaply that I can read it on the internet without a paid subscription to anything! It’s a wonderful time to be alive!

Oh, I guess it's fashionable to add a disclaimer so the black helicopters don’t come and lock me in a bank vault without my reading glasses or something right? Fine, I make my living breaking big atoms into little atoms so nothing I say or type should ever be considered medical, financial, legal, or romantic advice. Good enough? Let’s go.

I can’t find an old blog post I read in the 2009–2011-time frame to give credit, but it was pretty insightful, the blog author did a word search for “customer” in both the Amazon and IBM earnings call, and showed how Amazon (huge number of times saying “*customer*”) would be a better investment because that’s where their focus was compared to IBM which had very few hits for “customer”.  I haven’t checked, but I think Amazon has had slightly better returns than IBM from 2009-present.

CTRL-F for “*customer*” returns **53 hits** for TM, things like:

&gt;“And Toyota is always listening to customers, always trying to develop products that are suitable for every part of the world. And we have to remember that the goal is not electric vehicles. The goal is carbon neutrality. And even if we have the best technology, if it's not chosen by customers, it will not have the impact of reducing emissions and that's the reason why we've chosen to have a full lineup, and we've invested in all of these technologies.”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call shows just **10 hits** for “*customer*” with things like:

&gt;“we had not yet begun customer deliveries”  
&gt;  
&gt;“what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit”  
&gt;  
&gt;“continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles”

Quite a difference in company philosophy!

Starting off with the prepared statement, this company is a beast! Their fiscal year begins and ends in March so this is for the entire Covid year without the benefit of the Jan-March 2020 pre-Covid or the reopening time after vaccinations ramped up, this is the worst possible time period and the sold 9.087 Million vehicles (96% of 2019 numbers) under the Toyota/Lexus name and an additional 7.646 Million consolidated vehicles (85.4% of 2019 numbers).

Quick note, they use the term “electrified vehicles” to include Hybrid (HEV), Plug in hybrid (PHEV) and battery electric (BEV) and Hydrogen Fuel Cell electric (FCEV). The sales of electrified vehicles were 112.3% of 2019, which I think were mostly HEVs.

They went through all the various gains and losses to operating income (currency exchange rates, marketing, cost reductions) and overall operating income went UP by 10 Billion (JPY not USD). Then announced the dividend at a payout ratio of 29.8%. Announced a resumption of share buybacks (had been suspended during the pandemic) of up to 250 BILLION (JPY). Also, a five for one stock split will happen on September 30 2021.

Next the future projections, consolidated 113% of 2020, Toyota/Lexus 105.6% of 2020, and expected 2.8 Million electrified cars 129% of 2020 (29.2% of vehicles sold will be electrified). Again, a breakdown of predicted expenses with an overall prediction an operating income increase 365 Billion (with a B, in JPY)!!

Next, they took questions. First question wanted more detail on predicted finances which they answered, then a very detailed discussion of the plan:

&gt;“By 2050, we are to realize carbon-neutral. That is our target. The new vehicle CO2 is not the point. Transport use -- this overall cycle of CO2 use will have to be made neutral. That will be the point. So at this point, rather than restricting or limiting the types of technologies to be used, in order to realize carbon neutrality, various options or various technologies will have to be addressed. We think that will be the most important point and that is where Toyota is putting its entire efforts in. More specifically, we at Toyota has HEV, PHEV, battery EVs or BEVs or FCEVs”

From later in the call, but I wanted to move it here since it explains how they define the term:

&gt;“What does carbon neutrality actually mean for the automotive industry? Carbon neutrality for the automotive industry means achieving zero CO2 emissions in all processes throughout the lifecycle of manufacturing, transporting, operating, fueling and/or charging, and recycling and disposing of vehicles.”

Then they discuss very specific breakdown of anticipated sales of electrified vehicles by region by 2030 and:

&gt;“And globally, this will add up to 8 million electrified vehicles, including hybrids, out of which battery EVs and FCEVs in total would account for about 2 million units. That is our plan. Of course, ultimately, the choice is up to the customer. But at this moment, this is what we are forecasting.”

Followed by a detailed discussion about the scope of the challenge for future battery production and:

&gt;“at the moment, Toyota's supplied power is 6 gigawatts hours. And in order to realize these numbers, 180 gigawatt hours is necessary; in other words, 30 times the current number. So if you translate that into EV production lines, currently, we have two lines, but that will have to be more than 60 lines, that is more than 30 times. So we will make aggressive investments so that we can realize that. And in addition to that, for battery development or basic units will be reduced, and we will work with alliance partners for procurement so that we can procure the necessary goods. And in addition to that, for battery EV development, compared to the current situation, 15% to 30% reduction in development lead time is to be aimed at. “

And

&gt;“So for the investments, electrification case, digitalization, roughly speaking, on an annual basis, we are currently making an investment of JPY 1 trillion. This year, compared to the past levels, we intend to increase investment by 20%”

Did you notice that number, Trillion! I ran out of fingers and toes to count how many zeros that was.

Next the BIG question: “**how do you see the supply demand forecast for semiconductors**?”

Well:

&gt;“The supply demand situation still can fluctuate and we cannot sit back and relax yet, but we are not forecasting a major impact by semiconductors”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call:

&gt;“yes. This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a huge problem.”

Am I just cherry picking, trying to sensationalize something for clicks? Well, here is **what Ford had to say** in their earnings call:

&gt;“The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team, as our underlying strength at Ford improves”

Then another important question “you also showed the outlook for carbon neutral for 2030, and you talked about 6 million, and your plan was to increase carbon-neutral vehicles and PHEV. And could you share with us the reason why you believe customers will be choosing those vehicles?”

Remember the customer! Here’s part of their answer:

&gt;“And for 2030, for one thing, as Mr. Kamisawa mentioned in his own question, the battery EV, its prices and availability of infrastructure on the global situation is not likely to progress significantly. That's one assessment. And with respect to hybrid EV and plug-in hybrid EV, those are easier for customers to choose and use.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I would like to add further to that question about the Japanese data. We are focused on connectivity or connected. And through connected network, we obtain information and data on vehicles. And even in the case of hybrid EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs, especially in urban areas, the distance traveled by electric mode is quite long. And probably, we can share with you later on, but in the urban areas, generally speaking, there is some difference between urban area and suburban areas, but in urban areas, even in the case of hybrid electric vehicles, about 50% of the times, it is running on the electric mode.  
&gt;  
&gt;And in the case of PHEV, of course, there are differences in conditions, but 70% or 80% of the times, it is driven on pure electric mode. So hybrid EVs or plug in hybrid EVs, not just their performance and also the data that we can obtain through connectivity, and also, we use information we obtain from navigations. And using that, depending upon where the vehicle is located, the EV mode ratio can be increased or decreased, so adjusted. And those can be doable in the future through hybrid vehicles as well as plug-in EVs. So we would like to make contribution to the environment in a sustainable manner as well as practical manner.”

So the first hour of the two hour call was intended to be focused on the financials and the second half on the future (more long term plans) for electrification, batteries, data and Woven City. The questioners wanted to focus on all that stuff right away, so they answered the questions."|investing|Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021)|20.0|0.79

It seems illogical to have your retirement rely on a system that is based on past performance from only the past 95 years. If a 20 year old starts investing today until retirement at 65, that’s 45 years. 45 years is 47% of the S&amp;P 500’s existence, yet people say there’s enough evidence to expect a certain future return. If we had 1,000 years of historical data showing that the S&amp;P returns 10% annually, I think that it would be ok to say that 10% can be expected for a 45 year window of retirement investing.

&gt;How are things at the $2 billion deli?

&gt;&gt;Hometown International, the mystifying New Jersey deli company that is valued at nearly $100 million on the stock market — despite running just a single deli — has ousted its CEO, according to a financial filing. 

&gt;&gt;Paul Morina, a local high school principal and renowned wrestling coach in the area, was removed after a vote by majority shareholders, according to the late Friday filing.

&gt;&gt;Morina owns about 1.5 million shares of the Paulsboro-based company, which are worth more than $18.5 million based on the company’s current stock price. 

&gt;&gt;Shareholders of the company also ousted the company’s only other executive, vice president and secretary Christine Lindenmuth, who works in her day job with Morina as an administrator at Paulsboro High School.

&gt;Here is the filing, from last Friday. It is not quite accurate to say — as the New York Post’s headline does — that shareholders fired Morina. It’s more that they demoted him. He lost a lot of titles:

&gt;&gt;On May 13, 2021, the Board removed Mr. Morina from all officer positions he held with the Company, including President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of the Corporation, effective immediately as of such date. 

&gt;But he still runs the deli:

&gt;&gt;Mr. Morina and Ms. Lindenmuth remain principals of the Company’s operating subsidiary, Your Hometown Deli, LLC.

&gt;See, Your Hometown Deli is a deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, that occasionally sells sandwiches, mainly to curious financial journalists. Hometown International Inc. is a U.S. public company, with a basic market capitalization of about $100 million and a fully diluted market cap of about $2 billion, that is some sort of mechanism for taking a foreign company public in U.S. markets and that also happens to own the deli. The $2 billion public company is now run by Peter Coker Jr., a Hong Kong-based financier who was already the chairman of the board and a major investor in Hometown International, and who “intends to devote his full time to seeking a business combination for the Company,” as the company said back in March. It makes sense that the mergers guy in Hong Kong would run the $2 billion company that’s in the business of merging with an Asian company, and the wrestling coach in New Jersey would run the local deli in New Jersey. Sensible division of labor! It was always weird to have the New Jersey wrestling guy in charge of the Asian merger company! Also it’s weird that they’re the same company.

&gt;The deli has had some other good filings recently. Yesterday it disclosed that its quarterly report will be late, “because the Registrant needs additional time to complete certain disclosures and analyses to be included in the Report.” The relevant quarter ended on March 31, before Hometown became famous, so the problem is not that they sold so many sandwiches to so many financial journalists that their accounting systems couldn’t keep up. I assume that, given their recent scrutiny, everything just needs to be lawyered a bit more carefully than it has been in the past.

&gt;Also here is an April 30 filing in which Hometown “disavows the price of its publicly quoted stock on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol ‘HWIN.’ Management is aware of no basis to support the Company’s stock price, based upon its revenue or assets.” I am not sure I have ever seen a company “disavow” its stock price before, but I suppose it makes sense. The filing accurately notes that “there has not been, nor is there, significant trading volume in the Company’s stock,” so it’s not like anyone is particularly getting ripped off by the deli’s weird stock price. It’s just a weird artifact. Still, probably best to disavow it.

1621350044.0|0.0|t3_nfcxdz|57.0|"**Deal Structure:**

The deal will be carried out in the form of the Reverse Morris Trust, which implies spinning off WarnerMedia into a separate company, let's call it NewCo (no official name yet), which will then merge with Discovery. As a result of the transaction, the share of the current AT&amp;T shareholders in the new company will be 71%, and 29% of NewCo will be held by the current shareholders of Discovery. AT&amp;T will receive $ 43 billion from the NewCo in return for the transfer of media assets (WarnerMedia) to NewCo. The structure of the transaction (Reverse Morris Trust) will eliminate the need for AT&amp;T to pay income tax on the transfer of assets.

**Debt:**

The new company will own WarnerMedia, Discovery's current business, but it will immediately have $ 58 billion in debt ($ 43 billion from AT&amp;T and $ 15 billion from Discovery). WarnerMedia and Discovery's combined EBITDA in 2020 was $ 12 billion (expected to grow to $ 14 billion by 2023). I would like to point out a negative point right away. At the close of the deal, the leverage of the new company will be 4.83x. However, the company plans to cut it to 3x by 2023. High leverage of NewCo, as well as uncertainty about NewCo's valuation, caused a correction in Discovery shares on this news. Management also expects operating synergies of $ 3 billion per year from the merger.

**Revenue and FCF:**

Discovery's revenue for 2020 is $ 10.4 billion, WarnerMedia's revenue was $ 30.4 billion. Total revenue for 2020 for the two companies is $ 40.8 billion. The new WarnerMedia &amp; Discovery entity is projected to produce roughly $8.4 billion in free cash flow if you follow the free cash flow conversion guidance given in the announcement.

**Valuation:**

If you do the math, taking the share ownership of 71% AT&amp;T holders and 29% Discovery holders and base the valuation of the new entity on the $43 billion price for Discovery's 29%, you get a total value for the new entity of roughly $105 billion or 12.5 times projected free cash flow of $8.4 billion.

Let's take multipliers for the entire media sector. The sector average EV / S multiplier is 4.38, excluding Netflix, the multiplier is 3.31. Netflix has the highest multiplier in this sector (8.6), which affects the calculation of the average multiplier in our sample. I take the EV / S multiple since the spread in the EV / EBITDA multiple is even more significant. Accordingly, 3.31 will be the lower bound of our estimate, and 4.38 will be the upper bound. The Enterprise Value range will then be from $ 135 to $ 179 billion. The market value of the new company will be equal to EV minus debt, that is, $ 77- $ 121 billion. The fair value of the Discovery share is $ 22.3-35 billion. vs current $16-18B (depends on the series DISCA/DISCK/DISCB), a 25-45% upside.

**What analyst say:**

* BofA estimates the combination is worth about $148B in enterprise value; correspondingly, it's staying Neutral on DISCA with a price target of $40 (now 22% upside from current price).
* Deutsche Bank calls the deal a ""clear positive"" for Discovery, and says it helps AT&amp;T get back to core distribution. From Discovery's perspective, this is ""the deal we hoped they could get done"" and it should be highly effective in driving DTC subscriber and revenue growth at home and abroad.
* Bank of America estimates the new Discovery/WarnerMedia entity to be worth approximately $148 billion enterprise value. This attributes a 13.5x multiple to 2030E direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) discounted back and a 7.0x multiple on CY22E legacy OIBDA. When applying Discovery's 29% stake, this equates to an implied Discovery share price range of $39-42/share.

**Share classes:**

As for Discovery share classes, the spread is narrowing (between nonvoting DISCK to DISCA, to 7% from 15%). So now that the arbitrage is over DISCA should be going up along with DISCK. Not sure how DISCK will move - better avoid it as it's x2 of DISCA/DISCK and once the vote passes it may collapse...

Thoughts?

I'm a DISCA holder -&gt; correction -&gt; after much thought and investigation you should own DISCK.

DISCA and DISCK are common shares and the only difference is that DISCA has voting rights. Since the company is merging with another there is no voting value, and value of DISCA slowly erode while DISCK come closer until DISCA=DISCK. Currently there is a difference of 7% between them, so you can get this as well.

CPI spike in 2021 is likely “transitory” as suggested by the Fed, due to economic reopening and supply chain constraints caused by last year. We are also still far from full employment and the tech driven deflationary forces are not going away.

Also keep in mind that the current ongoing inflation is procyclical: prices in the US have risen rapidly because the economy reopened rapidly. This is not the same as the countercyclical inflation of 1970s. Over the past 30 years, the SP500 has performed most strongly during periods of rising growth and rising procyclical inflation.

&gt; Coinbase Global, Inc. (“Coinbase”) (Nasdaq: COIN) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “notes”) in a private offering (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Coinbase also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $187.5 million principal amount of notes solely to cover over-allotments. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Coinbase, will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on June 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at Coinbase’s election.

A little surprising to me given the recent IPO and the fact that they trade below ipo reference price ($250, current close is 248.24, ~3% additional drop after market on these news). I still feel investment in $COIN presents an interesting way to expose oneself to crypto without actually holding crypto (and the whole “sell the pickaxes in the gold rush”).

I know that not everyone has a precise method to do DDs and research about a company or a stock, but maybe someone does.I'm  from Europe, i'm pretty new in this world and i'm trying to be as more informed and smart as i can.

So, there are some things you have to do if you want to become a successful investor / trader, one of the most important is certainly to research and understand the company you're investing in and the financial instrument you're about to use.

When it comes to do some DD about a stock, i understand there are multiple things to look at.What are the most important in your opinion ? What instruments do you use and why ?

Heres what i'm doing for now:

I usually start reading about the company, its core business and the news about it, then i try to understand what is the financial / economic condition of the company and then i do some technical analysis on the chart, focusing on the price and the value i think the stock could have, and also using MA, EMA, MACd, RSI indicators.

I use mostly Yahoo Finance and [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) for the economical and financial part, and mostly WeBull for the charts.

Finally i try to find some smart opinions on Reddit and maybe discuss the stock with someone else.

Any suggestion ?

I've read that equities usually take a hit because it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow (so they borrow and invest less and are therefore estimated to have earnings decrease relative to some previous amount/projection, or they borrow the same but have to earn more of it to pay it back, which is harder for them to do or siphons profits from dividends/re-investment et cetera).

I've also read bond values in general take a hit because people don't want to hold a 10 year bond at 1.5% when they can hold a 10 year bond at 2% so they sell the lower-yield bond and there are fewer buyers so the price goes down and all that. Different bond durations react differently, but they all decline, at least temporarily.

If these two understandings are generally true, which usually gets hit worse from an interest rate increase, stocks or bonds? Or do they both get hit the same? Is there a duration element to the decline in value that each experiences, or is that the same as well? Basically, all else being equal, simply from a growth point of view, which is better to hold when interest rates go up? Or are there just too many variables to consider (how much interest rates go up, how quickly, and for how long they're expected to stay at that level)?"|investing|When interest rates go up, do stocks and bonds get hit the same?|23.0|0.76

BASIC COMPANY INFORMATION

Lockheed Martin is aerospace and defence company which provides very high-end military equipment. Aircraft is where they particularly shine with the F-35 accounting for about 30% of the company's revenue.

The lion's share of the company's revenue comes the united states government. Most of all aircraft used by the air force comes from this one company.

CEO INFORMATION

Lockheed recently announced in 2020 a new CEO to run the company. His name is Jim Taiclet .While having several years of experience with Lockheed, his previous experience as CEO was not with another defense company.

Most of his career was spent running the successful REIT known as American Tower (AMT). The company has been very successful both during and after his tenure. (Which is another great dividend growth company I might add).

DIVIDEND HISTORY/SAHRE BUYBACKS

Quarterly Payout (At A Glance)
2020 - $2.60
2019 - $2.40
2018 - $2.20
2017 - $2.00
2016 - $1.82
2015 - $1.65

Dividend Yield = 2.68%

Payout Ratio = ~40% (Very Safe)

Let me start be saying that this company is EXTREMELY  profitable. The company is currently on an 18 year consecutive dividend streak. Not to mention the company buys back BILLIONS of its own stock year in and year out. I fully expect this company to be a dividend aristocrat in a few years.

The dividend yield is about double that of the S&amp;P as of today and only has a Payout Ratio of about 40%. This means that not only does this company has a good yield while buying back stock, but this company can EASILY afford to maintain and RAISE the dividend over time dramatically.

https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/stock-information/dividend-history

MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS

The company has a long history of M&amp;A activity and the most recent example of this Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD). This is yet another example of the company using its financial fortress of a balance sheet and exemplary cash flows to acquire other businesses.

AJRD is a space and aeronautics company which could potentially extend more deals with NASA and the U.S. government. This was recently announced about six months ago in December 2020 and is likely to finalize in 2021.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The company has incredible financials. The balance sheet is a financial fortress. The debt load is very controllable. Cash flows continue to pour in record numbers year after year and 2021 guidance issued by the company expects record revenue and record EPS for the year. 

The Biden administration just issued an increase in defense spending of about ~1% earlier this year. All the more reason for this company's financials to continue to stay healthy. Financials linked below....

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/balance-sheet/

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/cash-flow?p=LMT

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/financials?p=LMT

GROWTH STORY MOVING FORWARD

LMT is expected to grow top-line revenue numbers 4.50% in 2021 and 3.70% in 2022. Earnings per share for  the company in 2020 finished at $24.58. This is expected to grow to $26.68 in 2021 and $27.90 in 2022.

Contracts are usually signed many years in advance. Revenues can be easily forcasted for the next several years due to the timelines of the contracts. Furthermore, innovation is not only encouraged, but expected by shareholders AND the united states military is order for our nation to maintain relevant in terms of weaponry.

New age military equipment is usually pretty ""hush-hush"" on what is in the works but Lockheed Martin does disclose some of these new products including technologies such as new highly intelligent drones, missile systems, and even targeted lasers.

One thing is for sure, the military will continue come out with bigger and badder weapons. Who will likely be selling it to them? Probably good ole LMT.

Newer acquisitions such as the recent AJRD deal allows Lockheed to also focus on other products in the space category and is another wildcard with some potential.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE/ BARRIER TO ENTRY

If you were given 10 million dollars, and your goal was to create a globally recognized soda brand, could you get it done? Maybe. What about 10 million to create a social media platform? Also a maybe. But could you start a aeronautics and/or defence company with 10 million budget? Absolutely not.

The regulations are incredibly strict. The demand for capital is VERY HIGH with projects frequently running into the billions of dollars. Switching from one business to another poses risks for the government and our military and are usually avoided.

This makes the U.S. government very loyal and sticky to LMT business and this is very likely to continue. While there are competitors in the space....Lockheed continues to dominate this market.

VALUATION (WHY IT'S A GREAT BUY IMO)

As mentioned earlier, the company is expected to produce $27.90 in EPS in 2022. Based of of today's price of $390, this gives this company a forward PE ratio of ~13.9. This is an EXTREMELY low forward PE ratio for a company putting up record numbers and dominating the market that it operates in. 

This is even more impressive considering it's still off a fair amount from it's previous all time highs. I am very bullish and this is one of my largest positions. I am not remotely interested in selling. I am buying at these prices or really anything even close to these levels. I wouldn't sell a share if this company were to go to $800 a share tomorrow morning.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER

Almost all revenue comes from one customer (the government). It is steady and consistent but if the government were to fall out of love with Lockheed then this company would be negatively impacted.

There aren't many who could take down LMTs throne but their main competitor is Boeing. Boeing has the capital and leverage to compete with Lockheed Martin long term.

This company is susceptible to a number of different geopolitical risks. Conflicts with other countries could be both a Negative AND a positive for Lockheed.

The current political climate is leaning harder and harder towards a more relaxed defence budget.

**Why TKC?**

So I have been researching about Turkcell, a Turkish company that is traded in BIST (Istanbul stock exchange) and NYSE. It had my attention because its been under performing compared to both global stocks and Turkish stocks (even though it's been performing really well financially compared to other companies traded in BIST). Before dipping to $4.67 USD due to pandemic in late march - early april, it was traded for $5.77 USD (early march 2020) and it was around 10-11 USD during 2018. As of today, it's traded for only $4.56 USD. Biggest reason for that freefall of the stock price is downfall of the Turkish economy and the devaluation of the Turkish lira but other Turkish stocks doesn't seem to care as much as TKC does. For comparison, march 2020 dip of XU100 (adjusted by the USD exchange rate of that time) index was 114 (857/7,5), now it is 171 (1441/8.4). There has been a Turkish stock exchange rally even in USD terms as well, which TKC missed. Not to mention that Turkish banks performed terribly and they have around 17% [weight in the XU100.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqbtfSZXUAEnwu0?format=png&amp;name=small)

**About the company**

So the company is primarily a telecommunication company (like Vodafone). Even though it offers value added services like BiP (mainly whatsapp alternative), Fizy (spotify alternative, TV+, Paycell (fintech), Pasaj (e-commerce mostly selling tech products), Lifebox (cloud service), Yaani (search engine), Dergilik (digital publishing platform) it's primary source of income is telecommunication and internet for home via Superonline (Turkcell company). The company operates in Turkey, Ukraine (lifecell), Belarus, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Netherlands and Germany (though their operations in the last 2 are not directly profit seeking afaik). Main competitors in Turkey (main market) are Vodafone and Turk Telekom. Vodafone and Turk Telekom offers cheaper prices but Turkcell offers better service and as of today it has the highest share of the market with 42%. Turkcell also invests more than the combination of the competition, [you can check their mobile data segment investments here](https://hwp.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mobile-yatirim.jpg). One last fundamental thing about company's operations is that it is part of the [TOGG project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOGG) (electric car company founded recently and according to their CEO, they will start the mass production is 2022) and owns 19% of the TOGG as well. The taxes for foreign made cars in Turkey are extremely high and the rumor is that the government is thinking about subsidizing this project to decrease country's account deficit by both not depending on foreign made cars and oil (which Turkey doesn't have).

**Financials**

I don't want to rewrite what is already written in detail so I will provide some sources instead.

[1st Q 2021 presentation (1.1B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Presentation-Q121-ENG.pdf)

[Annual report of 2020 (4.24B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Turkell-IAR-2020-ENG.pdf)

Their net income kept growing for a while, you can check more about their financials [in their website here.](https://www.turkcell.com.tr/en/aboutus/investor-relations) Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yIDdTqig4k) as well.

**Possible things that may drive the value up.**

I already talked about the TOGG project above, but the investors seem to didn't care about it. I think they have their doubts about the project (which is understandable due to fragile Turkish economy). But I believe if the mass production starts in 2022 it will have a really good impact on the stock.

Another thing is possible IPOs. In february this year, CEO stated that they are considering the IPO of their home internet company, Superonline. According to bloomberg, they started talking with the investment banks about it in April. You can read more about it [here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/turkcell-is-said-to-approach-banks-on-ipo-plan-for-internet-unit) Also, they were considering the [IPO of Global Tower in 2016](https://www.reuters.com/article/turkcell-globaltower-idUSL8N1CU4JX) but they didn't do it calling the market unsuitable for a new IPO. Considering the IPO madness happening in Turkish market, they may also consider it. I also want to remind you that vodafone did a similar IPO last year and they had a pretty good valuation.

Lastly, the stock had management issues before. The company couldn't share dividends and it had decision making issues as well. But as of June 2020, this problem is solved because Turkish Wealth Fund bought the stocks from Telia and Karamehmets. Now the company gives dividends quarterly (0.39 TRY per quarter and the stock is valued 15.20 TRY atm in Turkey, not sure about it in NYSE). I believe investing in TKC just because of the dividend is an enough reason.

**One important thing that caught my eye**

Last month one of the foreign institutions sent the [mandatory notification](https://www.kap.org.tr/en/Bildirim/932236) that their shares passed the 5% barrier. I was watching their aggressive purchases and they keep buying. [This is the buyers-sellers chart for the last one and a half month](https://imgur.com/a/juARwKD). Gedik investment made the 77% of the purchases. Gedik then transferred it to Deutsche bank. During that period amount of shares which are **held by the foreigners increased by 30 million stocks.**

**Why you should NOT buy/why is it undervalued?**

As I mentioned above, TRY is not performing well. Lately, Turkish Lira lost good portion of it's value. This is the main risk for this stock in my opinion. But the thing is, **82% percent of the float is held by the foreigners**, and even though the foreigner's interest in Turkish stock exchange kept decreasing, their shares in Turkcell kept increasing. It seems they think that it is a good buy despite the risk of Turkish Lira. I also believe that it is a buy for sure long term, but it is risky for the short term. Also, even if the TRY performs well, there is a possibility that with the possible interest rates increase, **DXY may start it's bull run which will negatively affect the stock.**

Another thing is, in October, Letterone will have the ability to sell some of their shares in the stock exchange. It is not clear whether they will or not, but it is risky since it will increase the shares traded. Last year, they sold some of it on the market for 15.5 liras per share (15.20 is the current price of the stock).

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

I believe that this stock is a good buy because of their financials, dividend, investments (mainly the electric car project TOGG), incoming IPO and accumulation of the stocks by certain investment group. But there are 2 main risks as well, fragile Turkish economy and the stocks held by Letterone. But even with those risks, I dont think it will devaluate more at this point."|investing|Turkcell Communication Services ($TKC), why you should/shouldn't invest in it.

**What I learned from Q1 call** 

**Three Big Drivers for the future** 

* CTV 
* UID 2.0 
* Solimar Platform 

**So why do they matter?** 

**CTV** 
- CTV is an umbrella term, compromises of both Internet T.V and smart T.Vs.
- More consumers switching from Cable to CTV 
- Major content owners moving more premium content online 
- T.V providers continue to fight for consumer attention 

**Current Problem**
- Advertisers currently are paying premium prices to publishers (Websites like ESPN) without getting the value of said premium price. 
- The Trade Desk would allow them to not only receive that value but advertisers would now have the ability to be more deliberate about what CTV ads they buy and how to apply data driven decisioning in T.V at an increased scale.


**UID 2.0** 
- This in TTD's eyes is the future of the internet in a world without cookies. This would essentially replace them. 
- I will do my best to explain said function, but to understand why does this need to be a thing and what is it solving? 

**Current Problem** 
- What the TTD is trying to accomplish is to create a free and open internet, an internet that can move past the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, Apple Ect. In fact the CEO Jeff Green uses the following sentence. ""Is the internet going to be controlled by large tech companies or will power be distributed. Will choice sit with consumers and each content owner?""

- We've heard of google and apple ending third party cookies in an attempt to ""protect"" their customers, which is true to an extent. 

**What UID 2.0 going to do to change the internet** 
- UID 2.0 is Open Source meanings you are able to build on it, and it is about a better internet allowing consumers to have control.
 
**How it Works** 

**1)** Consumers sign in once with an email (this email is your *common ID*)
**2)**  You will opt in site by site, app channel only once
**3)** When you log in once, you will receive an email authentication providing consumers with the explanation of the value exchange of the internet. The idea is to make it clear and consistent. 
**4)** This common ID will be used by advertisers and publishers 
**5)** Consumers are then able to use privacy settings to change or opt out directly from the services they know. 
**6)** The consumer controls their data, it's not controlled by Big Tech. 

**But its Big Tech, how can they penetrate those ""Walled Gardens""?** 

- *Double Encryption Publishers (DEP)*
- This allows publishers to encrypt UID 2 and allows them to unencrypt it for certain advertisers or publishers. DEP prevents others from taking data and insight from publishers. (Yes even Big Tech) 

**Solimar** 

- Solimar is the TTD's biggest platform upgrade in their history (Well that's what Jeff said)
- It is bringing together current existing features TTD offers and is making it easy to use for marketers 
- **Koa AI** for example is a current feature the is being upgraded and integrated into Solimar 

**Koa AI** 
- Koa AI is well... AI. It analyzes data from across the internet to help make sure you’re reaching the right audience at the right price. As Koa learns, it optimizes your campaigns automatically.

- ""Solimar helps advertisers want to understand how their campaigns are driving in-store sales. Building that off-site data into Solimar, whether it's retail stores or auto dealerships or ticket sales or any other form of business performance data, so the advertising campaign can seamlessly optimize for those business goals."" - Jeff Green

- He explains it better than I could
 
- Solimar helps solve the problem of media marketers who have big plates to fill and who are running massive campaigns. 
- Solimar liberates the media trader to focus on campaign performance rather than having to turn the dials on every aspect of campaign management

The article states that T shareholders will maintain a large stake in the new entity. It’s unclear (at least to me) whether these media assets will be a new company altogether or be a part of Discovery.

Perhaps this suggests some of these media assets will push into cord-cutting and streaming, further suggesting the end of linear TV.

The deal is likely an attempt for HBO Max and Discovery + to form a giant conglomeration that can take on Disney + and Netflix. AT&amp;T owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and Warner Bros. Studios. Discovery owns Food Network, HGTV, TLC, and Animal Planet.

&gt;Billionaire George Soros’s investment firm snapped up shares of **ViacomCBS**, **Discovery** and **Baidu** as they were being sold off in massive blocks during the collapse of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management.  
&gt;  
&gt;Soros Fund Management bought $194 million of **ViacomCBS Inc.**, **Baidu Inc.** stock valued at $77 million, as well $46 million of **Vipshop Holdings Ltd.** and $34 million of **Tencent Music Entertainment Group** during the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing released Friday. A person familiar with the fund’s trading said the company didn’t hold the shares prior to Archegos’s implosion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Soros also increased its bet on **Amazon.com Inc.** and homebuilder **DR Horton Inc.**, which is now its second-largest public equity position.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 13F, which money managers overseeing more than $100 million in U.S. equities must file quarterly, revealed that Soros held $4.5 billion of U.S. equities, down $77 million from the prior quarter.  
&gt;  
&gt;The biggest exit in the quarter was **Palantir Technologies Inc.** Soros sold 18.5 million shares valued at about $435 million. The firm originally revealed it owned a stake in the controversial data-mining company controlled by Peter Thiel in November, but rapidly issued a statement saying the original investment was made in 2012 and it regretted the decision.

That company is AT&amp;T (T) and we’ll break-down some opportunities &amp; challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.

**The Overview**

AT&amp;T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&amp;T’s communications segment contributes \~79% of operating revenues and \~80% of profits. AT&amp;T’s recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&amp;T’s development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&amp;T’s revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.

In this day and age huge “value” is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&amp;T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.

**HBO Max**

One of AT&amp;T’s biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service’s subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently **increased expectations** of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here’s a look from their recent earnings presentation  

AT&amp;T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \~800k lines and an additional **\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.

**Final Thoughts**

When we look at AT&amp;T’s share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn’t necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&amp;T would be a better investment than a “more secure” bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&amp;T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.

A 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \~6-7%, allows AT&amp;T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&amp;T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&amp;T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor’s portfolio.

The outperformance of PSLDX is pretty clear. I am not very familiar with its methodology, but I did some reading and encountered the opinion its outperformance may not last due to a potential rise of interest rates. So I looked at a couple of other metrics--please keep in mind I don't know much about the bond market overall and would be happy to learn I have examined things incorrectly. 

I chose 2016 because it captured when the Federal Fund Rate started to meaningfully rise (they also started to rise in 2015, but I chose a nice 5 year slice). They increased steadily into 2019, then plateaued a bit, then of course were struck down by covid.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)

Next I looked into the daily treasury yield curve rates from this period. The 10 Year rate fluctuated steadily all throughout 2016 but ultimately ended the year higher. It fluctuated similarly through 2017, ending very slightly lower. It increased during most of 2018, then only ended slightly higher by the end of the year. It lowered through the end of 2019.  It ended much lower by 2020. And through today it is higher than in 2020, but still much lower than it has been in years. 

[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2016](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2016)

Below is a plot of the dividends paid from PSLDX, where all the gains are to be had.

[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history)

You'll notice the higher dividend payouts tend to correspond to where the higher interest rates are plotted. Granted, the fund holds the S&amp;P, so its outperformance can in part be explained by the general rise of the S&amp;P 500 equities since 2016. But, I did not find where higher interest rates pose a risk to its performance. I also noticed its highest-ever dividend payout was in 2013, where the federal funds rate was miniscule and the 10 Year increased from 1.86 to 3.04 by the end of the year. And even when interest rates are very low, say from 2020-2021, the fund still outperforms the S&amp;P ETF listed, much less our favorite REIT. O, I can forgive, since I believe in its long term success. 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)

It appears the fund generates a great deal of alpha the higher interest rates become. It also generates alpha when interest rates are low. Drawdowns can indeed be high, so if one were to invest in the fund, it is likely best to put money into it after it has experienced a drawdown, or simply do what investors should do and put money into it that you don't plan on using for many years. 

The share price is low--this is common with many mutual funds. Someone recently mentioned that as a drawback to it... yes, it is lower than the 10 dollar price in 2007... but I think if you understand this is a particular sort of fund and not some silly low budget penny stock, the difference is clear. It is a volatile fund, yet appears to have an overall stability over time, with extreme dividend payouts. While I think broad market ETFs are great for capturing the mood of the overall corporate economy, the more I read about this particular fund, the more I find it to be a good choice for outperformance over a multi-year period. People worry about so many things: expense ratios, volatility, weird methodology. Yet, total returns tend to present their own strong argument for an investment. 

It appears to benefit from higher interest rates, and also does fine with lower interest rates. That is what I find to be especially interesting (ha). It's not a 3x leveraged daily fund subject to decay or anything like that, to my knowledge. It may even be simpler than your average PIMCO CEF.  

I plan on trying to learn more about the fund before I actually put money into it, since I want a firmer grasp of its mechanics and especially want to determine if it can maintain its performance over more time. In the meantime, I think it's overlooked by everyone but niche investors. Plenty of garbage tickers are passed around on Reddit (hello bizarre mortgage REITs that obviously destroy value over time and fraudulent SPACs) but there is little popular information on this fund which is still kicking out solid performance since the Great Recession when derivatives really were the devil. 

Anyway when I post on Reddit, I do so to learn. I very recently posted about the fund here--this was before I looked at interest rates and how they may correlate with it. I am becoming more convinced it is a good investment and would like to know arguments against it beyond the fact it's more complex than a simple passive ETF."|investing|S&amp;P 500, Realty Income, and S&amp;P 500 Long Duration|21.0|0.81

Fundamentals on Google are sound: strong recurring revenue base, monopolistic tendencies, value add to customer, network effects, cross selling across revenue streams etc.  I find it hard to argue that Google is going anywhere anytime soon.

Valuation wise, many think that FAANG is overpriced.  Some of it is.  Google trades at a whopping 37x earnings! But only 24x forward.  And only 15x fwd EV/EBITDA.  That is the metric I will focus on for now as I tend to use DCF models with EV/EBITDA terminal values.  The average EV/EBITDA multiple over the last 10 years is about 16x.  The lowest was 10x and 10x is the lowest it ever traded since IPO.  Using a DCF model and using ultra bear scenario of the following assumptions: 2022-2025 revenue growth of 0% annually (yes, correct),  gross margins of 55% (below the 10 year average of 60%), operating margin of about 23% (10 year average 25%), D&amp;A constant at 8% of revenue, Capex in line with Bloomberg estimates approx 16-17% of revenue, and change in NWC of about -3% (consistent with last 4 years).  WACC is 9.5% and used a 10x exit multiple.  This estimates an intrinsic value of $2068, about -9% from current values.  And that is the bear case with ultra bearish assumptions.

The base case then with revenue growth of 10%, same margins, higher depreciation based on consensus estimates, and an exit multiple of the 10 year average of 16x yields a price of $4831, upside of 112%.

Of course, I never truly depend on a DCF model to provide an exact price because there are so many assumptions that will never play out as expected, but it is a great tool to identify what factors impact price and some worst case scenarios.  It is further evidence to me that Google is one of the most undervalued large caps with a wide moat around its largest product, expanding its range and interconnectivity of its products constantly, and generating a significant amount of cash in the meantime.

Let me know your thoughts.

Edit: Cant disagree more with the Mod post below.  EV/EBITDA is a widely accepted method of DCF analysis especially when comparing firms with varying amounts of leverage.  EV/EBITDA is a terminal multiple used to estimate a value for the company at the end of the forecasting period.  The forecasting period still uses FCFF.  I find it weird that these mods can just post their OPINION on these threads and state it as if it is a FACT.  All of my thesis and modeling is clearly opinion and open to discussion, where the Mod is not for whatever reason."|investing|GOOGL - What am I missing?|169.0|0.92

Normally it's hard to guess their cost basis given that 13-Fs contain delayed data. In this case, we know for SURE that the best they could buy at was $220.

I excitedly bought my first lot yesterday at $209 after hours and I intend to DCA more over the next few months. MSCI China just entered bear territory, it's possible that we're near a floor.

I don't know much about business in China. I have no interest in building DCF models. I gave a cursory glance to the SEC filings and earnings transcripts, but given that BABA is an ADR and China disallows foreign auditors, I don't know how much to read into the numbers. 

One thing is for sure - I won't be able to slice and dice all this data better than the most respected value investors in the world, working only part time and weekends. 

But I can copy them, and fate has given me an opportunity to outdo them on price!

Looking out for Burry and Buffett's 13-Fs to hit EDGAR. If one of them has bought $BABA, I'm buying more stock. If both have, I'm going apeshit on leaps.

Edit 1 - If your best bearish argument is “CCP”, that validates the strength of long thesis

Edit 2 -

I am long BABA ADR. I do not have any other interests such an employment, directorship or consultancy with the issuer

Edit 3 - Neither Buffett nor Burry seem to had added BABA in Q1'21. This does not change my long thesis, but I may hold off on the LEAPs and stay in shares for a while."|investing|It's time to start piling into $BABA LEAPs..|560.0|0.83

Say what you want about Seeking Alpha, but this writer is generally considered the most analytical author there and in no way limits her team's work to Seeking Alpha. I notice some people don't like the website, which is fine, but this woman could write for Forbes or academic journals etc. if she wanted to do so, in my opinion.

The article looks at inflation, money supply, international responses to inflation, and its effects on different classes of people. It also touches on how different asset classes may play out under different conditions.

Of note is her conclusion that people who scream hyperinflation are farcically wrong, but she also notes when short term heavy inflation rears its head it stays on and doesn't dissipate. Say, if 5% inflation happens one year, it remains, even if it doesn't feature heavier inflation going further. Like many things in investing, the likely outcome is the middle road.

She also points out how the macro economy may be trending more towards labor over capital. Overall I think such effects would balance out, as better wages and cheaper equities seem great to me personally, although she doesn't delve very far into the thought.

My portfolio is equity REIT heavy so I especially liked her explanation of how real estate does okay with both higher inflation and higher interest rates, contrary to popular belief. Entry point is key--fixed rate debt is of course the best to have in an inflationary environment. 

""Interest rates: When interest rates rise, it puts downward pressure on most asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1970s. When interest rates remain low, then monetary inflation remains a decent environment for asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1940s from the market bottom in 1942.""

""Pendulum swings: Whenever the balance of power favors the wealthy, due to some combination of offshoring, automation, and the political environment, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into asset price inflation. Whenever the balance of power shifts towards labor, due to labor onshoring, labor organization, and/or populist politics gaining a foothold, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into consumer price inflation. This is largely correlated to wage increases or lack thereof, as well as being correlated to the size and scope of government transfer payments and tax policy.""

""Inflation: During periods of moderate to high inflation, gold and commodities tend to do extremely well. Equities outperform bonds more often than not, but it depends on the type of equities and their starting valuations, and therefore have a huge variance. Real estate does well, mainly because leverage attached to it gets melted away from inflation. Bonds do poorly in inflationary environments.""

""Deflationary shock: If temporary deflation is caused by a deflationary shock, such as a recession or depression, bonds are the place to be, and outperform everything else. Gold also generally does fine compared to other assets. Stocks and commodities usually perform very poorly.""

""Productive deflation or disinflation: Bonds and stocks do well in goldilocks periods of strong real growth, with low inflation and high productivity gains. Between the two, stocks can do better. Commodities and gold are prone to poor performance in this type of environment.
My base case going forward continues to be that with the combination of sizable broad money supply growth, along with public opinion pushing the pendulum back away from globalization, consumer price inflation is likely to be higher in the 2020s decade than in the 2010s decade.""

These points may be common knowledge to some, but I found it informative. Consumer price inflation is pretty identical to what we think of as ""inflation,"" so it seems fair to submit inflation will be higher than we are used to but not catastrophic or anything. So, for me, I like to think my REITs, most of which have pretty strong rent escalators linked to CPI (up to 3% annually with base increase no matter what), will do fine over a multi-year period. 

I hate precious metals since I don't really think of them as hard assets--it's just a series of price quotes to most people who hold it--there is some correlation to real estate. Consider how the ticker LAND had pretty extreme outperformance compared to its own asset class during 2020 which is still ongoing since that REIT focuses on owning specialty crop farmland with water rights. It outperformed gold swiftly, yet probably appeals to the same kind of buyer and pays cash dividends. 

I'd also like to remind people many REITs invest in free-standing properties on a triple net basis and that retail stores are still opening up en masse, largely among discount retailers which easily co-exist with internet commerce in poorer areas (think Dollar General, which works with companies like Instacart). Even with covid there was no retail apocalypse among corporate discount retailers. Most of these lease to REITs and pay a good deal of rent.

It may also be worthwhile to consider that with higher than usual inflation comes a risk of higher than usual interest rates being implemented, again, not to a catastrophic scare mongering level. Financials that focus on offering floating rate loans may do well over the coming years. Burry recently invested a good deal of money in a multi-cycle weathered business development company, Ares Capital, which would organically benefit from even minor rate hikes.

I think the best thing I pulled from the article is: don't worry so much. Inflation will happen, but it won't be insane. Perhaps focus less on long duration equities, ie. very high multiple tech corporations, and at least consider adding assets that are more down to Earth."|investing|Lyn Schwartzer on Inflation Trends|45.0|0.88
1621019470.0|0.0|t3_ncgfqa|17.0|"Fears of the U.S. economy running hot receded on Friday after new data showed a slowdown in consumer spending in April.

Retail sales were flat on the month, falling short of expectations of a 1% gain. However, the monthly gain for March was revised up by a full percentage point to 10.7%., leaving aggregate spending roughly where economists expected it to be over the two months.

Core retail sales fell 0.8% on the month, rather than rising 0.7% as expected. Here too, the March figure was revised upward to a gain of 9.0% from an initial estimate of 8.4%.

James Knightley. chief international economist with ING, said via Twitter that the staged reopening of the economy also meant that spending was draining away from goods to services. 
""Re-opening means increased options for spending money, meaning a movement away from “things” to “experiences” that aren’t measured within retail sales,"" Knightley said.

The figures once again testified to idiosyncracies in consumer spending patterns as the economy emerges slowly and unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic: sales at auto dealerships rose 3.1% on the month, corroborating the robust demand for cars that had also been evident in the sharp rise in prices for vehicles in April's inflation report earlier in the week.

By contrast, sales of apparel fell 5.1% and sales at hobby and sporting stores fell 3.6% on the month, having surged in March. 

March's data had been skewed by the effect of stimulus checks arriving at households across the country which, coupled with the start of economic reopening, had resulted in an explosion in overall spending.
""It was inevitable that there would be some declines in spending in April given that the vast majority of the $1,400 checks had already been paid out the previous month, but the details show sales in most categories reversing only part of their earlier surge,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics in a note to clients.""

Hunter noted that spending on food and drink services rose 3% on the month, after surging 13.5% in March as bars and restaurants across the country reopened in growing numbers. It's now only 2% below its pre-pandemic peak, he argued."|investing|Retail Sales Stagnate in April, But Offset by Upward Revision to March Data|17.0|0.83

tldr, I'm having a crisis of confidence in buy-and-hold index investing strategy

**Backstory:**

I'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. I just sold off a lot of my stock. I'm waiting for the account to settle to see my new allocation, but I'm certainly under 50% stocks at this time. I have no debts.

I have been a buy &amp; hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people  throwing money at speculative investments (crypto, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night.  I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now and that led you to value investing? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? The knowledge requirements to be a value investor seem much higher than for an index-fund investor. It's crazy intimidating. Do I just start reading your investment bibles and leave my money on the sidelines until I understand how make investment decisions in individual companies?

tldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do?

1620975834.0|0.0|t3_nc2i7c|41.0|"Wondering what everyone's thoughts are on the upcoming Exxon annual vote that's being contested by a group called Engine No 1? They are seeking to break up the current board and vote in 4 of their own candidates in order to push the company into a greener direction. To grab a quote off their [website](https://reenergizexom.com/), ""ExxonMobil lacks a plan to create shareholder value in a world that seeks to decarbonize"".

I'm not really a seasoned investor, but I generally agree that Exxon stock has been underperforming for years partly because of increased demand and feasibility of cleaner energy, and the end of the petroleum energy's dominance is encroaching (we're inevitably going to run out of the stuff). The only ""green"" move by Exxon has been to invest heavily in carbon capture and storage; which is fine, but I'd like to see Exxon soon put together a solid plan to gradually transition out of strictly petroleum and get more involved in wind, solar, and other renewables - I'm most likely being really naive here.

In theory I like Engine No 1's objective but I guess my main concern is how effective or sincere they would be in their push for green and cleaner energy? Maybe they're just some investment firm using all this as an opportunity to place their own members on Exxon's board who'll just cash in and ultimately won't fulfill their stated objectives? I honestly don't know, and Engine No 1 probably won't get the votes they're looking for anyway. I'm anticipating that at some point I'm going to eventually divest from Exxon while putting more of my money into clean energy ETFs or something.

Anyone want to share their opinions or insights on any of this?

There are a number of other suggestions in the comments of similarly ill-fated IPOs which I could not add for brevity's sake.

11 of the biggest COVID tech IPOs in 7 different categories (cloud, crypto, gig economy, app economy, e-commerce, fintech, and real estate), all crashed following stellar public offerings. Prices rounded to the nearest digit.

* SNOW went down from $430 ATH in Dec to 314 in Feb to 232 on Apr 30 and 185 today.
* COIN sunk from ATH of 429 to 250 after narrowly missing earnings expectations today. At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $**429**. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!
* DASH crashed from ATH of $256 in late Feb to $110 yday before reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today. They're up 8% in after-hours.
* BMBL halved from $85 ATH to $39 after beating expectations yday.
* WISH crashed from ATH of 33 to 8 after earnings yday.
* CPNG is down from ATH of 69 to 31 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.
* Qualtrics (XM) crashed from ATH of $57 to 29 today.
* SPAC merger OPEN crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.
* ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled.
* AFRM is down from ATH of $147 in Feb to 47 today.
* Deliveroo (LON: ROO) crashed from ATH of £3.9 on IPO day to £2.3 on Apr 26 and trades at £2.4 today.

The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.

But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. Hot 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which - except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

These companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend over weeks either preceding or following earnings."|investing|A reckoning for tech: 2020-21 IPOs Coinbase, DoorDash, Bumble, Wish, and Coupang record all-time low stock prices this week|1317.0|0.96

This is everything I've heard, but I'm just believing it less and less.

I did a quick test here just on [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7xOheId6-4rdjC6HHa-hemlfH7u6SZGT9d6i8cXVYU/edit?usp=sharing). In short here is the performance of $100,000 (dates are rough, not the definitive start and end dates of the period in the titles)

So obviously, having an allocation towards bonds helped during times of crisis, especially in the drawdown period, but not so much in the long run.

Surprisingly, even the added value of being able to rebalancing isn't so definitive versus holding. During prolonged downturns, you're rebalancing more into equities which continue to drop further and faster than your bond component. During recoveries, you may be rebalancing away from equity momentum.

Finally, if the bond allocation is only better than 100% equities during downturns, and if the long-run has 100% equities outperforming, isn't trying to have a bond component for the option to rebalance during downturns almost akin to market timing?

Is the only reason for bond allocation at this point volatility dampening effects? if that's the case should we be looking to cash? or even less correlated assets? or more diversification?

If the drawdowns didn't affect your ability to afford your life, i.e. no need to draw on even 20% of the portfolio for the next 10 years, should we just be 100% equities? Presuming the stomach allows it?

I know this might have been a roundabout way going at what we already have a rule of thumb responses for. ""no need for it if young and high enough risk tolerance"" or ""(120 - age)% in equities, rest in bonds"", but I'm having a hard time seeing even the slightest benefit to it. I haven't shown it here, but it's hard to even create a return/volatility optimal portfolio with it given recent data. Correlations are not as low as they need to be. If you really were a 70-year-old retiree, I would even say bonds don't have enough of a return premium relative to their risk over cash.

I would post this on /r/changemyview if it weren't so topic-specific. Why do you / would you include bonds in your portfolio?

Edit: so just to clarify, I’m not making the trivial point that bonds return less than stocks in the long run, or that they reduce volatility to your tolerance level - I’m just asking for the “pros” to owning them. The argument for being able to rebalance was the most compelling one for me (especially because I don’t have an income to dollar cost average), but I’m noting even that benefit isn’t super strong. 

I might look into the retiree case. I imagine another variable is ratio of expenses to portfolio. It would be interesting to see survival rates of different allocations on a 2 way axis against different expense/portfolio ratios and duration of living off portfolio. Maybe I’ll sim it out later. 

As a side note, despite this post, I do have a fixed income allocation. Granted, it’s levered such that the yield on cash is about 5% (it used to be as high as 12% on investment grade corporates)."|investing|The role of bonds in a portfolio|407.0|0.91

Let’s break down what covered calls mean. 

A covered call is when you buy 100 shares of stock and then sell a call contract. 

Covered means that you own the 100 shares so you are not using leverage since you own all shares of the contract. 

Calls are options that allow a buyer to collect profits after the price hits the strike price. 

When you do covered calls you sell these options on the options market. 

When you sell an option you get paid for the option to buy the stock at your strike price. I like setting my strike a few dollars above the current price. 

When the deadline of the option passes this contract expires. If the stock price is below the strike price then you keep all your shares plus the cost of the option. If it expires above the strike price then you give that money back to the person who purchased your option. 

Even if you have to pay someone that purchased your option that is a good thing as it means that you have recieved maximum profit on your trade. 

Worst case scenario the stock price drops. In this scenario you would be better off than the guy that just held 100 shares because you are also holding 100 shares but unlike a normal stock buyer you were able to collect the premium from when you sold the option.

The Chinese population growth slowing is seen as a bad sign indicated by the decline in Alibaba stock price the day this was announced. However, an important thing to note is that the Chinese are not only getting richer but the Chinese middle class seems to continue to grow which is the more important number ([Yahoo!Finance](https://news.yahoo.com/jack-ma-makes-rare-visit-123439015.html), [St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/january/income-living-standards-china#:~:text=However%2C%20since%20the%20measure%20is%20based%20on%20the,median%20income%20but%20far%20below%20the%20world%20average))*^(Important because this directly impacts the market that the company is in)*

**Risks**

Slower growth metrics and loss of market share from companies such as Pinduoduo and JD.com

Dark clouds of the antitrust regulations and potential future regulatory concerns

Tensions between US and China relationships may serve as risky for Chinese companies/holdings in the United States.

**Note on investing in China**

A common point that I see on Alibaba or any Chinese ADR is that China can nullify any value of what you own at any moment simply because they don't like a company. While there are some elements of truth to this, intuitively speaking, this wouldn't make sense for China to do since they're trying to welcome MORE foreign investment.

In addition, there are many mutual funds, ETFs, and individuals that have exposure to China than before as referenced by the Alipay and Yahoo scandal ([Source](https://news.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-alibaba-softbank-reach-agreement-alipay-160402485.html)) which would be counterproductive to the point above.

To cut the knees of their technology companies even further as they're positioning themselves to be competitive to the United States wouldn't make sense. A recent notable event was the introduction of the digital Yuan for Alipay which indicates Alibaba is aligned with CCP values and will continue to show their willingness to work with them ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/china-digital-yuan-alibabas-ant-joins-e-cny-currency-trial.html))

**Conclusion**

Alibaba seems to have put the antitrust issues behind them with the Alibaba's growth is slowing as indicated by analyst reported estimates and current earnings. Although this may seem alarming, Alibaba is continuously reinvesting into growth opportunities which can hurt their short term bottom line. The growing Chinese middle class and disposable income per capita points to more good signs than bad for Alibaba. The middle class and income numbers are far more important than overall population numbers. Regulatory concerns aren't over for Alibaba in its entirety but the business is very solid and they've shown a willingness to comply with any new introduction to Chinese regulatory policy.

**TLDR:** In a land of unattractive valuations in the current stock market environment, Alibaba with a forward P/E of \~20 seems extremely attractive for a long term investment despite short term volatility."|investing|$BABA - Analysis for Alibaba after Earnings|107.0|0.91

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltkij3/criteo_crto_why_one_of_the_biggest_adtech_players/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Though to be completely honest, the stock performance in the past 3 months hasn’t been as what I expected - mostly due to overall small cap tech getting crushed from asset rotation to reopening plays - but the company has been holding up pretty well against it’s peers. Criteo is more or less up around 5% in the past 3 months (15% off from recent intraday peak), while most of other small caps adtech players are down 40-60% from 3 months ago (even TTD is down almost 40%). 

I continue to feel Criteo is undervalued as a stock compared to its competitors and remain confident with the way the company executes their turnaround plan. For those of you who are not familiar with Criteo, they are making most of their revenue from Retargeting (80% of revenue) with the rest of 20% comes from higher growth areas. Here are the latest facts:

- Criteo is trading at around 2.5x ex-TAC revenue, while many of its competitors are trading at 10-30x (even after they came down by -40/-60%). 

- Retargeting which had been declared by most investment community actually expanded in Q1’21 (+4% for Criteo), even though travel industry hasn’t picked up and faces significant headwind from privacy regulations. 

- Criteo’s New Solutions (20% revenue) is growing at 60% per year with no signs of slowing down, helped by a shift to ecommerce by major offline retailers (Criteo is working with Target, Home Depot, Carrefour and many others) in which Criteo helped them to monetize their website. 

- Criteo has thousands of repeat brands clients (P&amp;G, Adidas, etc), which could use Criteo’s New Solutions hence expanding its Target Addressable Market (TAM) exponentially to more than $70B. 

- Google/Apple privacy updates will benefit those adtech companies that already owns 1st Party data, in this case Criteo is very well positioned. Criteo’s ecommerce reach is around $2B/day and enjoys exclusive access to major retailers/publishers. 

- Criteo is financially sound - it has $600m cash, generating more than $120m free cash flow per year (which is going to increase if New Solutions continue to grow, cost cutting work is also on the way) and with minimal debt. The company is having a buyback program of up to $100m this year, which has been used by $5m in Q1. 

Because of the above reasons, I believe Criteo provides good risk/reward as an investment."|investing|Criteo Earnings Update - Progressing in the right direction|17.0|0.81

As I understand it, inflation especially hyper inflation isn't a bad thing at all for a stock holder.
If your fiat of choice evaporates you wanna hold real values, like real estate or art, etc.
Why? Because they hold an intrinsic value that's not bound to a currency. And this is also true for stock's. So why fear it? 
I mean if you hold a large chunk of cash you should be scared of inflation and get rid of it.
Selling stocks because of inflation fears looks counter intuitive to me.

The only things I see here are that high inflation means the end of the endless money printing. Okay yeah get that. But at some point this has to stop anyways..

And maby a high inflation might make it more difficult for companies to make profits but that's all I can think of.

Right now I'm overweight in USD as that's where I have most of my non-short-term savings. I'm wondering, however, if it wouldn't make sense to exchange some of these dollars for euros and hold those instead.

Why?  Inflation is eating at USD right now, and I think the ECB (plus EU fiscal policy) will be less aggressive than the Fed and the US government, thus keeping EUR inflation comparatively low.  Thus, inflation will eat at USD but not at EUR.  Any thoughts on my analysis here?

The next question is if it would make sense, as I've said, to hold more euros instead of dollars.

Obviously there's a lot of factors to consider besides inflation, especially the forex relationship that I don't quite understand.  Would inflation cause the US dollar to appreciate or depreciate with respect to the euro?

There's also other risks like the US dollar potentially being more reliable, etc.

I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Things haven't significantly changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything."|investing|The Latest CPI numbers can be explained by the Lumber and Semiconductor shortage|120.0|0.88

Why?

Dealers had to keep 19.49% of the issued securities versus six month average at 24.2%

Direct buyers took 17.1% of the issued bonds versus six month average at 16.4%

Indirects (generally foreign investors) took 63.4% of the issued bonds versus the 59.4% six month average.

I was thinking about Ark funds and wasn't sure if I wanted to split it up between all of the individual funds or just keep it simple and go with ARKK. I wanted to know if ARKK was a decent representation of all of the individual funds. Kind of like if it was ""an ETF of all Ark funds"".

So I brought in all of the holdings into excel and conditional formatted for overlapping holdings. I then summed up the weighting from the ARKK fund to see how much of ARKK is comprised of holdings from each fund. Below are the results. 

ARKK shares X% holdings with X fund:

ARKQ: 24.59%

ARKW: 72.20%

ARKG: 30.63%

ARKF: 35.40%

ARKX: 6.53%

PRNT: 3.43%

IZRL: 1.4%

Obviously there's a lot of overlap so these numbers are going to add up to over 100%. 

But I was very surprised to see that ARKK is 72% similar to ARKW. Also surprised to see it's only 6.53% similar to ARKX, but that makes sense given it's the newest one.

1620834154.0|0.0|t3_narr02|3.0|"As the cloud &amp; big data continues to grow, as well as social media &amp; 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new crypto, Chia, has gobbled up about 3.5 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, growing at a rate of about 0.2 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a week ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $30 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 40 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.25 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 48 days, plus the 3.5 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 15 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra 5% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is."|investing|Western Digital - The Next Nvidia|3.0|0.54

Often times I hear about people who reach a $1 million net worth yet they don’t feel wealthy or satisfied at all when I believe that this should be viewed as a tremendous accomplishment. Getting to $5 million is impossible if you never reach $1 million. 

I view $1 million as the ticket to true wealth yet many people down play the idea of $1 million. So my question is, at which million did you feel wealthy enough and how did you get there (stocks - what was your strategy, real estate, crypto)?"|investing|Question for the investor millionaires: At which million were you satisfied?|147.0|0.92

Billionaire investor Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge -- something he says he used to knock others for doing.

“Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It feels very funny because I’ve spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?”

Zell, 79, said he’s concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week.

“Oh boy, we’re seeing it all over the place,” Zell said of inflation. “You read about lumber prices, but we’re seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It’s very reminiscent of the ‘70s.”

While gold is an attractive investment, opportunities in fossil fuels are not, said Zell, who in 2019 agreed to set up a joint venture with Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital Inc. to invest in oil and gas.

“Right now, oil and gas is not priced to reflect the risk of what’s going on, whether it be in the EV world, a climate changed world,” he said. “As recently as a couple of years ago I thought the risk-reward ratio was appropriate. It’s clearly become very inappropriate as our political situation has changed.”

Zell also said he’s concerned about renewable energy undermining the reliability of power grids, pointing to the recent blackouts in California and Texas.

In real estate, there are plenty of questions about what demand will look like over the next couple years in the office, lodging and retail sectors, Zell also said in the interview.

“Everybody’s worried about going back to work and office-space occupancy. I don’t think that’s really an issue,” he said. “The problem is that, before the pandemic, we were dealing with an oversupply of office space. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t reduced that oversupply and has probably encouraged it accordingly.”

Stores also present challenges, he said, given that the U.S. already had more retail space per person than the rest of the world before Covid-19, and shoppers increased their reliance on e-commerce while stuck at home during the pandemic.

“Street retail today is like a falling knife, and you don’t know how far it goes down,” he said. While that “doesn’t mean the best malls aren’t going to perform,” there’s a “huge amount of real estate that’s going to have to be reprogrammed in one form or another.”

The challenges faced by hotels are more of a temporary problem over the next three to four years, Zell said. “We will see a slow recovery in business travel,” he said. “In the interim period of time, it’s going to be a slow recovery, and hotels are big overhead things and running them at less-than-optimum occupancy is a very expensive scenario.”"|investing|Billionaire Sam Zell Buys Gold With Inflation ‘Reminiscent of the ‘70s’|43.0|0.8

These are just two strike prices, along the entire option chain, there is at least $1.2 billion in call options bought Today alone.  

I suspect that the rising tensions in the middle east can ‘fuel’ (gas joke sorry) bad relationships and cutoff ties with the United States. By doing so, we will become increasingly reliant on Exxon Mobil. Not sure how high this can push the stock price, but it is for sure a catalyst.

In my opinion, this has to be big money hedgefunds that are buying in.

&amp;nbsp;

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&amp;P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style. Also, this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance.

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major **outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in **a hedge fund that lost over 80% of it's AUM**.

&amp;nbsp;

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style fits into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&amp;P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category averages for years where no index data is easily available. 

&amp;nbsp;

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available) and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages (average of of active fund performance, after fees).

&amp;nbsp;

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

&amp;nbsp;

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 million in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/&gt;)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/&gt;)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/&gt;)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/&gt;)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

&amp;nbsp;

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds that I could find:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

All further sources will be at the bottom.

-   **ABSRP**: -13.81% (before fees)

-   PRNHX: -2.84%

-   Category: -19.98%

ABSRP beats it's category as the 2001 recession unfolds, but loses to PRNHX. Note that Cathie joined some time in 2001, so it's uknown how much of a contributing factor she was during this period.

Notes: During the 2008-2009 market crash**, Cathie exits CHCIX and starts to manage the AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (ALTFX)**, with some period overlapping while new management is onboarded for CHCIX. I have no information as for the management shuffle, only what I see on Morningstar.

&amp;nbsp;

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix, Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index), in addition to the Russell 1000 Growth.

&amp;nbsp;

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

&amp;nbsp;

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000) and VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) as a secondary benchmark. It turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform. 

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

-   IWF: 5.50%

-   PRNHX: 4.50%

&amp;nbsp;

**2016: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: -1.96%

-   VGT: 13.73%

-   IWF: 7.01%

-   PRNHX: 7.79%

&amp;nbsp;

**2017: Cathie OUTPERFORMS T Rowe, OUTPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: 87.38%

-   VGT: 37.07%

-   IWF: 29.96%

-   PRNHX: 31.49%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estimated Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC (estimated)**

**87.4% return with BTC included.**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

&amp;nbsp;

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

&lt;https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position&gt;

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&amp;P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark funds exceeded $50 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targets significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth.

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: lots of posts about how ARK cannot control inflows because it's an ETF. This is true and not Cathie's fault, but nonetheless it's a problem...or at least it's fair to say it's a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated ETFs. ARK is now suffering from the big AUM problem. Too much capital to chase after too few opportunities, victim of its own success.

* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.  


What do you guys think? I went and put 10% of my portfolio in this, was it dumb?"|investing|MX Arbitrage opportunity with a 6 months timeframe|13.0|0.82

Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible &amp; innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&amp;P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold &amp; wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett &amp; treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

Drugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.

“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space.

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

**The Youth in Existing Gun Markets Support Liberalization**
Something like 60% of youth support gun rights; this is a big indicator that government policy will not do anything to harm the industry to a large extent.



**Firearm Popularity is Rising Worldwide**
Markets like Brazil under Bolsonaro or the Phillipines under Duterte have increased firearm purchased through liberalization or idolization, providing a future for gunmakers outside of the US and Russia. I also see Africa and the rest of SE Asia liberalizing gun laws in the next few decades.



**The rise of hyperpolarization and populism**
Uncertain or polarized political circumstances means more people hostile toward one another. This was at the fore during riots last year and the Capitol Insurrection. Partially as a result, gun sales were at record highs last year. I see this polarization, due to the spread of social media, rising across the globe and thus, long term gun sales.



**Long Term Industry Consolidation is Likely**
As with many other industries, consolidation is very likely in the firearms industry as they inevitably face scaling and uncertain political climates. Investors will benefit most from this consolidation provided you choose a company not going bankrupt.



**There's just a lot of room to grow**
Gunmaker's supply chain is ridiculously overcomplex with lots of simplification that could happen (Glock rates higher in this but they're private :( ). The merchandising chain also leaves lots of profit on the table (suppliers, coordinators, retailers, etc.). Models could also be optimized, tech better integrated, etc. There's just a lot of cash to grow into.





All in all, the gun industry presents an interesting opportunity for growth, beyond their current trading dynamic, something I will be tracking in earnest. Just wish Sig and Glock were public lol.



My Picks:

- Smith &amp; Wesson: Will benefit most off of sales in the US, has enough cash on hand for consolidation opportunities, has ability to streamline, cult base, etc.


- Taurus: If Glock or S&amp;W are the Apple of firearms, Taurus is the Samsung, the mass market firearm corporation that I believe will be immensely popular in developing countries, considering its success in Brazil and Colombia"|investing|The Small Arms Industry is Set to Grow Rapidly|5.0|0.56
1620594296.0|0.0|t3_n8nkcd|529.0|"Traditionally, real estate was always seen as one of the best kinds of investment, but imo that's largely because knowledge on stocks was much more rare, and it wasn't as easy back then, since there weren't many investing apps, higher fees, and it wasn't as easy to do. 

While there are of course still challenges and risks, there seems to be countless reasons today why stocks are now much easier and better, and barely any reasons to invest in real estate, given how expensive real estate has become right now, and this is coming from someone who's followed investing for several years now, seen multiple crashes, as well as bull markets as well.  

With stocks 

1. The barrier to entry is much less, you just need an app or computer and can do it on your spare time. 
2. It's cheaper, you can start with as little as $100 to an infinite amount. Where I'm from, studio apartments go in the mid 6-figures, and even in lower costs of living area, you still need several $1000s for a down payment, on top of multiple other costs, and a stable salary to continuously pay your mortgage. 
3. It's more liquid, you can sell at anytime you need, of course probably don't want to during a down market, but at least it's an option. With real estate, you could be stuck holding onto property indefinitely, and the amount of work to sell or rent out is significantly greater. 
4. There is more potential and money to be made, even if playing the lower risk game, and choosing common sense FANMG stocks, many of these stocks have gone up 2-5 folds over the last several years, meanwhile you'd be hard press to ever find real estate that can go up even 2x within 5 years, if even in 10 years. 
5. Much less work, at least compared to real estate, where you have to physically manage, deal with tenants, work on the legal side, and all the other hassles that can happen running a property. 

I could see it being different before this era, when it was much cheaper, but it seems like today, stocks are significantly more accessible, liquid, much less work, and have a higher potential to make even more money from too, so is there really any point investing in real estate today, aside from the actual property you have to live in?"|investing|Why would someone invest in real estate today when stocks seem much accessible and better?|529.0|0.86

1620577266.0|0.0|t3_n8hkut|25.0|" Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

A bit of context here: I’m a chartered accountant working in senior management at a real estate developer. I have experience in valuations across most asset classes (stocks / real estate / business valuations etc). 

This is the first time I have ever seen every single asset class so substantially inflated: stocks, real estate, crypto currency. Whatever it is, every asset class is at all time highs. We all know the reasons why this is the case: excessive money printing &amp; all time low interest rates have created a yield hungry environment with inflated asset prices. 

I don’t want to waste time talking about why this is the case, but I would like to know, what are you doing to protect yourself against the eventual correction in asset prices? 

Quite honestly, I’m not sure what to do here. You either hold money in cash and risk missing out on further price appreciation, or you are fully invested and exposed to asset price corrections.  Thoughts?"|investing|Asset valuations - how are you protecting yourself?|1031.0|0.92
1620571698.0|0.0|t3_n8fpef|15.0|"So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"".
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up."|investing|Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)|15.0|0.73

If they dont get the railway, their SP should shoot back up. If they do get it, theyll have the first transcontinental railway going from across Canada down to Mexico.

Win win in my opinion.


Eidt: ok ok. To everyone saying self driving or electric trucks.

You realize CN and CP also use trucks. So they too would be using these electric trucks or self driving trucks.

 You also forget there is a lot of time saved going by rail rather than by road.

Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ? Is there any proof ?"|investing|Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returns|218.0|0.86

5 yr return:  37.78%

Standard deviation:  44.29  My account has high volatility

Sharpe ratio:  .83  My account's risk adjusted return.  My account has high returns but has had endure very high volatility to achieve those returns.  For comparison S&amp;P Sharpe ratio for the past 5 years is 1.09.  Higher is better.

Risk adjusted alpha:  7.01 A risk adjusted measure that measure's excess returns over an index.  Higher is better.  I have achieved higher than average returns compared to the index

Beta:  2.06 Measures volatility related to an index which has a beta of 1.  Higher means more volatility.  My account has been very volatile compared to the index

R2:  .48 Measures correlation with an index.  Lower number means low correlation with an index.  My account has low correlation with the index.

Since the demand for telehealth skyrocketed in 2020, it’s been a super hot sector with not only a lot of investments, but a lot of new players in the arena. As I’ve debated on which company to put my stake in, I’ve always had an eye on Amwell. It’s consistently been under the target price since it’s IPO and I think there’s a ton of potential here.

Fueling my logic is a recent WSJ article about how PepsiCo has switched telehealth platforms. The company stopped using Teledoc for telemedicine services and now uses LiveHealth Online, a platform connected to the company’s health plan that also happens to be powered by Amwell technology. 

I feel as though this revelation flew under the radar. If Amwell runs platforms that integrate better with company’s current health plans, it could become a serious competitor to Teledoc. Head of benefits at PepsiCo, Erik Sossa, says “Telehealth is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity.” This is true and I think this statement will guide the “what’s next” in the telehealth industry. With so many companies entering the market, what will set each one apart? Making it easier on employers by integrating with what already exists is a great way to gain a step-up on competitors. 

I’ll be continuing to keep a close watch on Amwell. The stock can only go up from here—and many analysts agree. Numbers look good and recent news suggests that the company is headed in a great direction.

Price-wise, gold was nearing peaks last seen 12 weeks ago, closing in on the $1,850 per ounce level, that could set up a return to $1,900 and ultimately the $2,000 record highs attained in August.

“Gold’s short-term momentum could make a run towards the $1,857 level, which could be followed by a move towards the $1,925 resistance level,” said Ed Moya, head of research for Americas at online trading platform OANDA.

Benchmark gold futures on New York’s Comex were up $15.45, or 0.9%, to $1,831.15 an ounce by 1:40 PM ET (17:40 GMT). The session high was $1,844.40. For the week, gold futures showed a 3.2% gain, the highest since the week ended Oct. 29.

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price — which reflects bullion for prompt delivery — instead of futures.

“Gold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. “From there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.”

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday’s rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

“There's a bit of disbelief around this number,” said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. “I wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.”

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

“Gold’s best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won’t persist,” said OANDA’s Moya."|investing|Gold Has Best Week Since October on U.S. Payrolls Shock|25.0|0.78

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index    fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately   determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
   * \*Edited: I should mention that when you make the trade you are paying a ""hidden"" fee of the spread between what you pay and what the stock was actually worth when you bought it as the Market Maker takes the split. Since you are either paying the spread, or management fees, you are going to be paying, you just don't have commissions on top anymore for the most part.
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have  had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing  in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due    to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the    index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when  Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on  11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up  the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the  stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more  people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular,  that’s because it is.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies    with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a    sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies    missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech  seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this as    necessarily a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite    compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being    found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the [best of the best of the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_huL5ynaI8Y)companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well    diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the    S&amp;P 500.

Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This    seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each  other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE  below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I    ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.   Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less   than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will   likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical   issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were   also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they   could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750    stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks   were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the    industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4    years was compared to this index value with the following type of    breakdown:

* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For    example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was    10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,    they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they  would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would  receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The    relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there    was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth    only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be    decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This    left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the    company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently    in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them    being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?    Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude    them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These    26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and    September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these   stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total    purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The    chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested    dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of  returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For    those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked  against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date,  including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&amp;P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850    tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.    The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More    metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were   then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to    determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to    median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of    the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3    stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over    the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry  is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that  benchmark.

Each   stock  was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics  and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score  out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics.  The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I  measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as  previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%,   Great &gt; 150%.  Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular  metric to find a useful distribution.

I    also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the   metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this   ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a   score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9   categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a   company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could   do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t   match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or   the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the   analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I    applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at    the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock    that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a    high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,    I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their    financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off    their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly    leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that    Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns    Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great    synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of    this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,    such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil    and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated    \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a    separate model.

I then looked at    each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are    all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit    margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,    etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We    were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at  each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better    understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was    not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last  year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I  only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

* I    partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was  critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to  build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing  for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the   credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.
* Interestingly    5 out of the 19 stocks that were eliminated in the last round of the    2020 experiment made it to this year’s list. 15 out of 26 of last  year’s   final picks also made it. I’ll post an update once I have more  than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to  answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.
* The indexes ended up heavily weighted in tech/semiconductors. This is the way the math pointed me, so that's the way I went.

Some could compare these business models with Amazon, but Amazon is a huge exception and it has a by far bigger network advantage over the other competitors like Walmart, and Amazon doesn't have any head-to-head competitor with the same propositions. You don't buy a power bank on Walmart.

Why am I thinking this:

1) DoorDash, Uber Eats &amp; Co. have the same product assortments, making these platforms purely interchangeable. Usually, the restaurants don't sell only on one platform but they are in all of them, and the skills/barrier of entry required to sell in a new platform are basically zero because they work the same, have the same fees, and don't have to do anything more.

2) They can only attract a meaningful profit only if they develop some form of advantage. Take Netflix, the only sustainable advantage they could have is to develop their own series/movies. Do you think is the same with the ghost kitchen? I believe that foods are purely interchangeable (except you have a differentiated brand like Whole Foods), not quite the same as a movie though.

3) They can compete with a better service, but it can be easily copied (and nobody has a substantially bigger advantage in network or scale), and there is also a limit on the convenience. Do you think customers care if one delivers the food 3-5 minutes before the other? Is it an enough competitive advantage for the long term?

The same thing applies to grocery deliveries like Instacart. BTW I'm huge bullish on Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods since 1) it controls the majority of the assortments with private labels 2) It controls the distribution 3) It doesn't need to spend $Bs in ads, hence lowering down the prices.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe they could ever be profitable? If yes, how? Looking to discuss with you."|investing|Will business models like DoorDash, Instacart, or Uber Eats, ever be profitable?|78.0|0.87

I was thinking to invest in the S&amp;P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks.

But by looking into S&amp;P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come):

\- AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.  Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. 

\- TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although

\- V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long.

\- Mastercard - see Visa Inc

\- NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over,  graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68

\- Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable

Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?"|investing|Possible overvalued stocks in S&amp;P 500|15.0|0.64

Unlike a lot of naysayers who think taxes, inflation, or certain political parties will derail this train, I don't agree.

* [Personal Saving Rate | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-saving-rate) , savings rate has averaged 18.75%. FYI, the highest the savings rate in the last 20 years for a 12 month period has been 7-8%.
* [Total Revolving Credit Owned and Securitized, Outstanding (REVOLSL) | FRED | St. Louis Fed (stlouisfed.org)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REVOLSL), people used funds to pay down their credit debt. Allowing them to take on consumer purchases into the future.
* $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus. Which contained much more than just $1,400 checks. It contained policies that will free people to join the workforce who otherwise would not, to start businesses, to direct capital towards areas long beaten down.
* \~4 trillion infrastructure, part 1 and part 2. Investment in R&amp;D, Nationwide BroadBand, EV charging, Electrical Grid, Education, Renewable Energy, Childcare, Eldercare. These investments will allow for a huge increase in the number of people who can participate in the workforce.
* Booming Jobs growth. Expect to see sustained jobs growth over 1 million jobs a month in 2021, expect to see a long term jobs growth story of 300,000-400,000 every month for years and years.
* [Wage Growth Tracker - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) above inflation wage growth.
* [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index) It is true that there is some increasing inflation showing up, even in personal consumption, but mainly due to isolated commodity supply chains. It hasn't shown up in food, despite what anyone thinks. Not in rents (increase 1.7% YoY, negative in many places). (40% of Americans rent), it hasn't shown up in the electric bill, in electronics, in cars, the one pain point has been gas prices. Which, continue to be offset by improving efficiencies, and in context, gas prices are lower than 2010. As far as buying a house, people paying up to buy homes are making discretionary choices that they can afford to make. People in existing homes (the by far vast majority of the 60% of households who own a home) are not experiencing much inflation, they have mortgages.
* So no. The Fed won't be raising rates. Commodity inflation will work it's way thru the system. Ala 2010. Oil prices dropped to $20, then bounced back to $110+. And many other commodities that were low in the financial crisis, only to rise very quick in the recovery.
* Stocks. So, the economy and the stock market aren't directly connected anymore in the US. See the financial crisis recovery. Stocks boomed, the economy chugged along gradually. See 2020. It was a hard real economy for 10s of millions. The stock market did not care. So, will a roaring economy mean a roaring stock market? I think, in the context of creating new retail investors during COVID, and now post COVID, who will be joining the workforce with substantial growth, an exaggerated inflation prediction that never comes to fruition in the long run, meaning low rates, and trillions more in spending, it's going to be a very good stock market.
* Taxes. Oh get over yourselves. High taxes have never meant the economy can't grow or the stock market can't grow. People (even the wealthy) adjust to tax changes and then keep doing what they were doing. The impact is short lived, both on tax cuts and tax increases. ""Tax increases"" happened in the 90s and the 2010s. That did not stop the stock market, or the economy.
* And it's laughable to call them high. The United States has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any advanced country. Yet trails in aggregate measures of education, healthcare, infrastructure, quality of life, environment. There's such a thing as lowering taxes for wealthy capital gains non labor earners too much. The US past that point in the 80s.

Recent posts about people losing their initial investments over the past 6-12 months made me think of this article that I heard the guys on the recent [Animal Spirits](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/05/05/animal-spirits-we-should-be-in-a-bubble/) podcast discuss. Over the past 10 years, 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished in the black, 36% finished in the red, and 22% are gone. Of that 22%, Morningstar does acknowledge they didn't check to see if a company went bankrupt or was acquired at a premium/loss but they did note, ""Bessembinder’s research suggests that half the expired stocks were acquired, with decent results, while the other half were delisted, with dire consequences.""

Basically what this research shows is stock picking isn't easy and probably shouldn't be done by most people, if any. There's a reason mutual funds and active money managers have been shown to trail benchmarks over short- and long-term timeframes. [This IBD article from March](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) shows only 25% of MFs beat their benchmark over varying timeframes. [This 2019 article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) shows nearly 65% of active fund managers trailed the S&amp;P 500 for the 9th consecutive year. If people who devote their literal careers can't do it, most retail investors probably can't either. It's just as much luck as it is skill. 

Note: if you don't give a shit about what my opinions are, do as my wife does and stop paying attention to me now. I only planned to post the above and then I just started jotting down thoughts that turned into more thoughts and the below was born.

If you want to pick stocks, probably the only hope you have is having a very long-term horizon and being diversified, but not diworsified. If you just want exposure to every industry for diversification purposes, just buy an ETF that tracks everything all sectors. 

Irony time: Save for my wife's retirement and our savings for future kid(s) (both of which I manage and both of which are in QQQ, SPY, and/or VOO), I pick stocks and although I have overall exceeded my chosen benchmarks (SPY and QQQ) over the past 9 years, I have no expectation that will last, which is why I benchmark. I ~~want~~ need to know how I am doing because if I absolutely suck and perpetually trail the benchmarks, I would be leaving easy money on the table. I don't want to do that so I manically track my transactions.

For me, I actually match the Morningstar numbers pretty well.

**Closed Positions**

|Beat SPY &amp; QQQ|Beat one but not the other|Trailed SPY &amp; QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45%|10%|45%|

**Open Positions**

|Currently beating SPY &amp; QQQ|Beating one but not the other|Currently trailing SPY &amp; QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|8%|57%|

Quick tangent. Open positions are doing worse right now because I continue to buy. I don't care about the isolated market choppiness currently going on (some of which I'm invested in) and I'm not sitting on a mound of cash waiting for a massive dip. I buy when I have cash ready and a company I want shares of. People seem to think entry point matters but it doesn't with a long-term view. Sure, $45/sh is better than $50 but what if it goes to $60 before that 10% drop you were waiting for. Now you have to buy at a higher price or live with the feeling you missed the boat (spoiler: you didn't; just fucking buy). Sure, some stocks will pull back to your entry point but if the thesis is good and remains in place, just buy when you can and add more when you can.

So if the majority of my positions are trailing at least one benchmark, how am I beating SPY and QQQ overall? To keep the theme going, having a long-term approach is why. I wasn't beating the benchmarks right away. In fact, it took 3 years before I was intermittently ahead of them and another 3 years before I was consistently beating them every month. Six years may seem like a long time to allot myself but, at the time, my planned retirement was 40 years away. I had a long runway to work with so I knew my risk profile could be high and I could continue to learn as I went along. I bought companies I believed would win over 10+ years and then I let my winners win. 

This is a divisive take but I rarely take gains on my winners. I don't need the cash now; this money was earmarked for decades down the road so I let it be invested. I even let some of my losers lose (looking at you Ford). I do everything I can to not micromanage my holdings. I monitor the news and quarterly filings but unless there's been a fundamental change in the business that renders my initial investment thesis moot, I hold. 

By letting my winners win, I allowed the SHOP's and the SIVB's and the AMZN's and the SMG's to make up in gains far more than my losers lost. Currently, my three largest gaining positions have increased in value more than all my losing positions (open and closed) **combined**. And those 3 largest gaining positions are all still open. I have never in the 5+ years I've been invested sold a single share in any of them and I see no reason to even consider doing so. It's cliched to say but the max you can lose on a stock purchase is 100% while the max you can gain is infinite. Don't overreact. Follow your thesis. I bought AMZN in June 2014 for $327.39 and it then traded basically flat for 7 months. Imagine having had sold that for a miniscule gain because I didn't see an immediate 35% return? 

All this being said, I absolutely understand why people would choose passive ETF investing. I enjoy reading about companies and perusing SEC filings. I view my investing as a hobby in addition to wealth building. Not everyone does. They may see the benefit of investing while viewing company research as work. Others may want to try to get rich quick. I would never recommend the latter but to each their own. I didn't hit it big on GME or AMC or become a Dogecoin millionaire but I also didn't FOMO buy only to lose 50% of my investment within a week and then panic sell. I'm not yucking anyone's yum. I just know the lane I'm comfortable in. Know your risk profile and how much you can lose without making your life uncomfortable, because any investment can drop 20% a day after you buy it and any investment can go to zero. You can't invest and also be undisciplined or prone to FOMO. You will almost always lose out.

I didn't mean for this post to turn into a soapbox speech but if it came off that way, my apologies. Just trying to convey some interesting research I heard/read with some lessons I have learned.

Those are only the outstanding shares.  They missed Tesla's diluted share count by over 100M in their newest model.  And before anyone mentions possible buybacks, their model already includes a $300 billion cash pile in 2025 to pad their EV/EBITDA PT.  No room for buybacks in their modeled capital allocation.

That's just what's provably wrong with the model.  Will Tesla create a human ride hail service with 3x more revenue than Uber in less than 5 years?   Will Tesla become the most profitable insurance company in the US in under 5 years?  Will Tesla sell sedans and crossovers at the same gross margins of Ferrari?  I can't say, but these are all standard assumptions made in ARK's ""bear case"" -- An odd context for the term.

I wouldn't be so crass if they actually learned from their mistakes, but they don't.  Their year end 2019 model projected Tesla would issue 30 million more shares through 2024; 900M to 930M split adjusted.  They issued 55M in 2020 alone.  34M were attributable to capital raises.  Maybe that would be a good time to step back and check what the diluted share count would be in the event Tesla hit their PT?  I could almost forgive a hobby investor missing the dilutive effect of, at the time, anti-dilutive convertibles and stock options.  Not a firm like ARK, but a hobbyist.  They brazenly miss their share count estimate, take no further look as to why they missed, and, by some miracle, totally miss the dilutive share count &amp; effects plastered all over Tesla's filings since Q1 2020.

To be blunt, these guys are either dumb or deceitful.  To those who invest in ARK funds, this is the level of DD you get.  Caveat emptor.

I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

\- Growth prospect and how to estimate it.

\- A best method at coming up with a price target given the above estimates.  Should it be a range.  What conditions should be attached to the price?

\-  Execution - given that the arrived price target is obviously a rough  estimate at best, best approach to use it.  That is purchasing all at  once, or add to the position as the company proves itself, i.e. if there was any know how as to what strategy works as opposed to what makes sense.

Some may look at PPE as a summer 2020 trend but that is far from true and PPE stocks will continue to perform well. One that I came across recently is Optec International (OTC:OPTI), a manufacturing company of LED and PPE product.

OPTI’s been making a slew of acquisitions, but one that I’m interested in is a company called WeShield. They have audited revenues of $55 million in 2020 and projected revenues of over [$100 million for 2021](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Inc-To-Acquire-WeShield-An-Established-AI-Driven-NY-MedTech-Company-In-PPE-Space?id=295925). The company says this growth is due to proprietary AI tech.  

Either way, OPTI is an example of an affordable PPE stock that I have on my radar, today they’re trading at around $0.09 a share. Other suppliers to keep in mind from an investing standpoint are 3M (MMM), DuPont (DD), and Owens &amp; Minor (OMI) - these are top PPE manufacturers and suppliers. 3M is being traded at just under $200, with DuPont at $79 and Owens at $35. These companies are established healthcare suppliers with Owens &amp; Minor, for example, being established in 1882. And like I was saying above, the demand for PPE IS NOT going anywhere. In April, Plastic News published an article citing Owens’ performance and stated that the pandemic will continue to boost the medical supply market as health systems expand their PPE supply.

I’ve been doing quite a bit of reading on value investing lately. My usual investment strategy is passive index investing (focusing on VWRA), plus a few growth stock picks (SE, SQ, TSLA). Generally, I’m a buy-and-hold investor.

Something about value investing spoke to me. Perhaps it’s the fundamental analysis or the patience behind it. I started looking for companies with low PE and PEG ratios, coupled with high forecasted EPS increases.

F jumped out immediately. I see that their revenue and earnings have declined in recent years, but with the EV revolution in full swing, is this a good pick?

Why I believe it’s undervalued (fundamental analysis data taken from Finviz):

1. PE of 11.76
2. Forward PE of 7.02
3. PEG of 0.24 (!)
4. EPS this year of 158%
5. EPS next year of 62%
6. EPS next 5 years of 48%

When they report, their TTM P/E will flip from above 35 to about 9 (yes, nine). They had a bad quarter 4Q ago as the company was undergoing some restructuring after a CEO change; so sometimes this stock has moved as if it's a high-P/E tech stock.  But really, it's essentially a deep value stock that also has ""explosive"" growth in ammo sales. Their market cap was 25% higher under Obama and the company's core lines have grown since then. Gun folks buy more guns’n’ammo under democratic administrations, not GOP ones.  The prior CEO was replaced (excuse me: ""retired"") because he made some bad acquisitions which have since been divested, and better ones made instead (e.g. acquiring Remington’s ammo business).  This stock benefits from civil unrest (note price bumps during G-Floyd riots last year), war, paranoia, etc. Basically: 'murica. You might have heard we nearly had some people in hats overthrow the government.  Those people all buy ammo.  Basically 15% of the country is gearing for civil war and VSTO had a billion dollar backlog at the end of 2020 -- about half their market cap.  The national ammo shortage still persists to this day.  Gun background checks are off the charts. VSTO has pricing power.

The weekly options are pretty high IV so they aren't an easy way to play this stock unless you're selling 'em. But I think VSTO is gonna pop on earnings, and long-dated options have much more reasonable IV. VSTO has multiple analyst upgrades recently (two major price target raises in the past two weeks), lots of free cash flow, and recently refinanced their completely reasonable debt to a higher credit quality. There's been good news about their new ammo plants (including Remington) coming online.  It's a candidate for buybacks or a special dividend.  They have 116 full-time job openings listed on their site; many of which are unrelated to ammo, so I guess those parts of their business are going well, too.

But wait, how have comparable stocks done this week in earnings?  Is this industry healthy?

1. $OLN reported after close 4/27, nice beat on earnings, stock up over 10% since, multiple analyst price upgrades.  They’re the other civilian ammo manufacturer (they have a pure chemicals biz for most of their revenue).
2. $BGFV reported after close 5/4, massive beat, stock up 30% the next day.  Sporting goods retail.
3. $RGR reported after close 5/5, beat estimates by 50%, stock up after hours (we'll see how far it runs: earnings conference call is this morning 5/6 at 9am ET), quarterly cash dividend raised 145% compared to 4Q ago and 20% quarter-over-quarter.  Gun manufacturer.
4. $VSTO reports before market open 5/6.  Outdoor goods and ammo manufacturer...

The main risk I see is any possible supply chain disruption (or cost increases) due to shipping.  But that just means demand is deferred forward, not denied, and they already have a huge backlog.  Its price has also run up a lot in the past year (like many stocks), but it’s not near its 2016 market cap and not at its YTD high.  Daily RSI is under 70 and trending up for those who care about technicals.

VSTO has a market cap of \~$2.1b.  About half a NKLA, half an AMC, 1/5 of a GME, or 1/10 of a SPLK.  Look up VSTO's numbers on finviz or macrotrends.  I’ll leave it at that.

Position: long shares @ $33.  Long-term bullish.  I might buy calls or sell puts, too.

tl;dr -- outdoorsman value stocks are reporting great earnings and VSTO is next in line, the country is a mess, you can buy ammo stock if you aren't just buying stocks of ammo.

Also I thought they reported after market close 5/6, so I was gonna post this in the morning, but apparently they report before market open (welp!).  So I'm posting it now.  Still useful, I hope, as this is not just a one-time earnings stock."|investing|Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) pre-earnings DD|19.0|0.85

A lack of growth is bad for any company, but is particularly tough for those like Teladoc that are losing money, whose share prices are pegged to their growth potential.

Last Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.31 a share, [much worse than the 54 cents Wall Street expected.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teledoc-health-drops-on-a-big-net-loss-51619645793) That news triggered more declines in the stock; it is now down 46% from its February peak.  

But the latest selloff isn’t just the aftermath of the poor earnings. This week, concern mounted over whether Teladoc can retain its customers in an increasingly competitive space.

In [a *Wall Street Journal* article published on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-health-startups-are-booming-their-customers-are-overwhelmed-11620039601), [PepsiCo](https://www.barrons.com/quote/PEP) ‘s former head of benefits Erik Sossa said that the firm stopped using Teladoc and switched to rival LiveHealth Online, partially because the digital-health service isn’t connected to PepsiCo’s existing health plan, making it impossible for doctors to see patients’ health histories. 'Telemedicine is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity,' Sossa told the *Journal*.

Investors are concerned that contract losses could become a more frequent problem. A recent Credit Suisse survey shows that 81% of the responding companies are offering telehealth benefits to their employees via health insurers instead of direct contracts. A decision to do the same is likely behind PepsiCo’s shift away from Teladoc, according to Halper. One of the firm’s health insurers, Anthem (ANTM), was the previous owner of LiveHealth Online.""

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&amp;#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&amp;#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them."|investing|Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3)|68.0|0.9

&gt;  
&gt;Peloton recalled its Peloton Tread+ and Peloton Tread treadmills today, according to an [announcement from the Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-and-Peloton-Announce-Recall-of-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Death-and-70-Incidents-Recall-of-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury), the government agency that oversees most household products, citing safety hazards.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Peloton Tread+ has been linked to dozens of injuries to children, including one death. The recall notice states that “Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**The company also notified the CPSC that its newer Peloton Tread’s touch screen can detach and fall, posing a risk of injury to consumers.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Consumers should immediately stop using the treadmills and** [**contact Peloton for a full refund**](https://www.onepeloton.com/)**.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Peloton Tread+ (previously named the Peloton Tread) has been on the market since 2018. A smaller treadmill, also named the Peloton Tread, was slated to go on sale May 27, with 1,000 units already sold in the U.S. as part of a friends-and-family presale.**   
&gt;  
&gt;The recall comes after the [CPSC, in April, took the unusual step of warning consumers](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/peloton-plus-tread-treadmill-urgent-safety-warning-cpsc/) with small children or pets at home to immediately stop using the Peloton Tread+. The company initially refused to recall its popular $4,300 exercise machine, according to a CPSC spokesperson, stating that the product was safe as long as users followed operating instructions.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The warning was based on reports of 39 incidents in which a person, a pet, or an object, such as an exercise ball, was sucked under the machine, leading to injuries in both children and adults, many of them serious. “These are more severe injuries than you would imagine with a treadmill,” the CPSC spokesperson told Consumer Reports at the time, adding that the agency had not seen these types of injuries with other treadmills.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In light of the CPSC’s warning and the severity of the injuries, [CR removed the Peloton Tread+ from its ratings](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/safety-concerns-prompt-consumer-reports-to-remove-peloton-tread-plus-from-ratings/) and stopped recommending the product while the investigation was ongoing.   
&gt;  
&gt;The treadmill’s safety risks first became apparent in March after [Peloton CEO John Foley wrote to](https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-) users of the exercise machines regarding an incident with the Peloton Tread+ that led to the death of a child. Foley advised consumers to “keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times” and to “remove the safety key and store it out of reach of children” when the treadmill was not in use.  
&gt;  
&gt;The widely publicized fatality prompted the CPSC to request information from Peloton, and the company disclosed to the agency that there were additional injuries and incidents tied to the Peloton Tread+.  
&gt;  
&gt;**As the CPSC investigated the reports, including disturbing** [**home video footage of a child being sucked underneath the Peloton Tread+**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y) **(and escaping without serious injury), the agency asked Peloton to recall its treadmills. But Peloton refused.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Shortly before the CPSC’s public warning, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked for details about the CPSC’s investigation and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., urged Peloton to issue a recall.  
&gt;  
&gt;The standoff with Peloton illustrates that the CPSC cannot force companies to issue a recall without taking them to court, even when the agency’s safety experts have tied a hazardous product to deaths or serious injuries.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The CPSC took a strong and principled stance for safety, and clearly that’s what made Peloton come to the table and agree to offer a full refund,” says William Wallace, CR’s manager of safety policy. “It shouldn’t have required so much time and effort to get this product recalled. This episode underscores why we need to overhaul our outdated laws, so the CPSC has the ability to take quicker, forceful action when a product is putting people at risk.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Acting CPSC chairman Bob Adler said in a statement today that he is pleased that the agency and Peloton have ultimately agreed on recall terms. He added that the recall “is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**Peloton CEO Foley apologized for the company’s initial response to the safety issues, and stated that “the decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s Members and their families. I want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”**

However, I'm not exactly sure how to implement this because...

1. Leveraged ETFs suck
2. Futures are better, but you're realizing your gains/losses quarterly/monthly, which creates substantial tax drag.
3. Not adjusting your leverage up/down with the market opens you up to blowing up your account in a crazy 4 sigma tail event (no matter how well diversified you are) even though you could have survived it by adjusting leverage downwards as the value of your holdings fell and up as the recovered (which, by my limited understanding, is what almost all risk-parity funds do...)
4. I'm pretty sure I can't go down to my local investment bank and ask them to make me my own TRS.
5. ITM LEAPS also cause tax drag and they aren't too liquid if I want international or factor exposure.
6. Not crazy on NTSX.

So, how can I ideally just buy ETFs as the core of my portfolio, get the cheap financing rates of futures (box spreads seem to fill this role pretty nicely, but open to other suggestions) while not having to realize my gains or losses while still keeping a relatively constant leverage ratio?

Rebalancing with inflows is definitely an option, but a prolonged sell-off could mean that the portfolio's leverage would be drifting up faster than me adding cash could bring it down.

Does anyone have any (systematic, ideally) strategies to ""rebalance"" using futures to offset positions (ie selling some ES contracts when SPY drops to reduce exposure to stocks when they drop while getting more exposure through ETFs as they recover?) or anything else that solves my conundrum?

Or is simply not using much leverage and praying that you never see a catastrophic, 1929 level loss in your lifetime (or the 20 or so years you would be using leverage before delivering as your near retirement) the only option to limit turnover and the associated tax drag (so not adjusting leverage at all).

With talks of looming inflation, and the rotation into value, inflation-protected, and ""reopening"" oriented stocks, I figure more than a few people are looking to adjust their portfolios a bit, and may have some similar questions.

Something I had not heavily considered before now are the advantages of futures compared to equity in the producers of a commodity. Say ETNs / ETVs like JJC or CPER vs. an ETF like COPX.

I'm curious what advantages there are behind going either route, or for some insight behind why one might pick one over the other in the current economic landscape."|investing|Commodities - Futures or Producers?|80.0|0.86

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish."|investing|Why You Should Short The Intel Fab Play|0.0|0.43

This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

Warren Buffet says ""I do not think the average person can pick stocks.""  Certainly it makes the most sense for many people to simply pick standard index funds for their 401(k), for example.

But what about the ""better than average"" investor?  Yes, I know that it may be presumptuous to assume that I could do better than professional fund managers, but it seems that it shouldn't be difficult to find companies within the S&amp;P 500 that beat the average more often than not.

To test this idea, I took a look at the S&amp;P 100 (not the full 500) and how each company did compared to the average over the past 10 years.  I picked the companies that consistently beat the average over the full 10 years, 5 years and 3 years.  Using a similar weighting as the index itself, I came up with the following portfolio of 20 stocks:

* **Communication Services**: GOOG, DIS, NFLX
* **Consumer Discretionary**: AMZN, TSLA, NKE, HD
* **Consumer Staples**: TGT, COST
* **Financials**: MA, V
* **Health Care**: UNH, DHR, TMO
* **Information Technology**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE
* **Industrials**: HON, UNP

I did not choose any companies from the Utilities, Materials, Real Estate or Energy sectors, but collectively these entire sectors comprise 10.1% of the S&amp;P 500.

This portfolio would have performed *significantly* better than the index over the past 10 years.  Even if you remove TSLA, the returns are about 3x over the index.

These are all well-known companies, many of whose products or services I use on a regular basis.  I know that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"", but it seems to me that that these high performing companies are more likely to continue to beat the average than not.

For an investor that is willing to keep an eye on their portfolio and make changes when necessary, instead of forgetting about it for 10 years, why wouldn't a bucket of stocks like this be a better choice than an index fund?  Why should we settle for the average instead of going with companies that are consistently better than average?"|investing|Index funds or stock portfolio?|19.0|0.66

&gt;	**Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

&gt;	The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

&gt;	Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

&gt;	**Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

&gt;	The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

&gt;	Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

&gt;	Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

&gt;	On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

&gt;	“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

&gt;	Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

&gt;	Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

&gt;	Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

&gt;	Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

&gt;	While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

&gt;	The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

Overall, the portfolio was up 0.24% for the week. This was mainly driven by our commodity trend allocation. The SPY was -0.11% while the TLT was -0.21%. Overall the portfolio outperformed the 60/40 during Week 1.

That being said, I received a lot of feedback on the original post. Namely, the portfolio was far too conservative to be able to grow at the expected 15% over time. 

I went back and look at Chris Cole's specific recommendation. It does appear he goes higher weight equities than we had originally allocated. Additionally, he uses leverage to achieve the target portfolio volatility of 15%. I was curious how this would work, so I ran some backtests using 3x leveraged ETFs for TLT, GLD and SPY. This backtesting is not perfect because we don't have a volatility component, but it proved to me you can get higher returns than the traditional 60/40 portfolio by using leverage.

* 3% IWM Straddle - This represents 3x volatility component we were previously long. The goal is to match the leverage we are using in the other allocations.
* 36% GNR - GNR is a commodity producer ETF that tracks the S&amp;P Global Natural Resource Index. I am treating this as a semi-leveraged play on commodities as we would expect the producers to outperform pure commodity plays. However, there is no leveraged ETF we can follow on this basket, so we are simply assigning double the portfolio weight. My thinking goes we have leverage from the producers. When combined with a 2x weight, we create an equivalent of ~3x leverage we have on our other allocations.

A note on Commodity Trend. There were many questions on Commodity Trend from the original post. Many people thought we were simply long commodities. This is not the case. The goal of this allocation is to be short or long depending on a trend following technique. For this portfolio, we plan to follow a simple 40/50 Moving Average cross over technique. Long when it's the 40 day moving average is higher. Short when the 50 day moving average is higher. You are free to use your own trend following technique if you want to customize our approach. The goal of this allocation is to capture the large moves commodities tend to have during periods of financial stress or strong recovery. For example, look at NYSE: TECK from 2007 to 2011. Imagine if you had a strategy that would benefit from going short on the downside AND long on the upside. This would have helped your portfolio out greatly even as equities and gold were performing poorly.

I will implement this when markets open Monday and will be tracking the new portfolio from scratch.

For Evart, a small American town in Michigan, these blurry lines are clear. As a provider of water for Nestlé, Evart serves as an example of a community-corporation agreement. The result of which, means Nestlé purchases and uses Evart’s water sources for private use – what some might recognise on the market today as Ice Mountain bottled water.

Challenges arise, however, within the terms of that deal. Having purchased rights to Evart’s water supply, Nestlé is free to pump out large amounts of water at a high volume – 250 gallons per minute, to be exact. And at a relatively cheap price: paying $200 a year to the community, Nestlé can pump 130 million gallons of water annually and sell that water for profit. This is all done in spite of the fact that unprecedented water pumping contributes to the degradation of Evart’s local wells, whilst also affecting the water supply actually available to locals. 

For some in the community, Nestlé’s promises of new factories in Evart and the fact that they bought the water in the first place, is enough of a positive. For others, Nestlé’s presence has sparked outrage within the Evart community, leading to some uniting as a non-profit organisation known as Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation.

It doesn’t make as much sense out of context, but when explaining the connection between the Ellsberg Paradox and your investment decisions, he concluded with this:

“All this makes investing in value stocks or small stocks the equivalent of trying to pick a black ball from Urn B: The higher ambiguity makes your odds of success feel less certain. Picking from the “predictable” growth stocks in Urn A simply feels safer. So most investors steer clear of value companies and small stocks, driving their share prices down, and pile into big growth companies, sending their stocks soaring - at least in the short run. Over longer periods, however, growth stocks and the stocks most popular with analysts tend to earn lower returns than value stocks and underanalyzed companies. By avoiding stocks that are high in ambiguity, the investing public makes them underperform in the short run - creating bargains that go on to outperform over the long run.”

For more clarity, the Ellsberg Paradox is a choice between two urns in front of you for a chance to win $100. You can’t see inside either urn. Each urn contains 100 balls. Urn A contains exactly 50 red balls and 50 black balls. Urn B contains exactly 100 balls; some of which are red and some are black, but you do not know how many there are of each. You win the $100 if you choose a red ball. Which urn do you choose from? Links would have been included here if I weren’t posting from mobile.

Yesterday, Ford released their Q1 results, forward guidance, and plans for the future. Due mostly to the lacklustre guidance, the stock dipped &gt;10%. Investment strategy aside, I believe the single biggest takeaway from Ford's report was their plan for the future.

While I'm a big fan of CEO Jim Farley, and his plan to make Ford a more focused (pun not intended) and lean company, I feel like he is focusing more on paths to a higher temporary stock price rather than proper long term investment.

To Ford and its management's credit, I do think they are attempting long-term investments, I just believe they are the wrong ones; Ford is investing heavily in electrification and autonomous driving, however, neither of those are sufficiently monetizable and are extremely capital intensive. Additionally, they are investing over a billion dollars for a factory in Cologne, Germany and streamlining the factory process. 

Expanding on my aforementioned comments, investing in autonomous technologies will not yield Ford any significant reward- they are too behind competitors, it's complex and capital intensive, and it would be just as simple for Ford to partner with, say, Waymo.

On the same wavelength, I believe Ford should increase their equity stake in Rivian and use their electric innovations rather than attempting to spend billions on developing their own. On the topic of electrification, Ford should not be attempting to electrify their core lineup of pickups and Mustang's first. It undermines the fundamental principles of both for the time being. Instead, electrification is best suited to the luxury segment of the automotive market- Lincoln for Ford. Electrifying the Lincoln brand could kill multiple birds with one stone, testing EV technology, revitalizing the Lincoln brand, helping increase margins, spending less on analog technology to do things like quiet the vehicles, and so forth.

Additionally, handing over control of their software to Google is a big mistake- it eliminates the prospect of extracting monetization from their vehicle, which will be a large aspect of vehicles and will allow competitors to undercut Ford by selling at a loss to extract later value, contrary to what Ford will be able to do.

A large issue for Ford when attempting to streamline their lineup and manufacturing process is potentially breaching union contracts by cutting staff- opening a factory in one of the most union-friendly countries in the world isn't helping that. The additional tariffs and whatnot for manufacturing less in the EU would be more than compensated with a more nimble organization. In fact, I'm a proponent of completely pulling the Ford brand out of Europe, which would aid in stressing the 'Americanness' of the brand, where Ford gets much of its appeal in the States. Additionally, once debt is paid down (more on that later), Ford should be working to slowly exit Detroit and expand its manufacturing clout in more business-friendly, union-hostile environments, such as Texas or the Midwest. Not only would this increase Ford's bottom line and transform them into a more agile corporation, but this will also enable greater employment in more states, meaning more lobbying power. 

Above all else, though, Ford should be focusing on paying down or buying back their debts- it's too much of a drag on long-term growth and investment ability. To do so, they should cut their dividend alongside other cost-saving strategies I've outlined.

After the debt is better managed, some key investments Ford should go for are investments in monetizable software, a reintroduction into the sports car foray (Thunderbird, anyone?), new factories in anti-union states, vertical integration of the manufacturing process (and focus on selling parts B2B), expanding their niche commercial operations (such as with police cars currently, they could expand into delivery and so forth), expansion of the high margin Ford Credit, lobbying to be allowed to cut out dealerships as Tesla has, and so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially:

* Increase stake in Rivian and use them to electrify (Lincoln first)
* Partner with a third party to integrate current autonomous operations
* Divest from Detroit and other union-friendly areas to become a more nimble organization
* Cut debt, dividends, etc.
* Double down on successful sub-sectors

&amp;#x200B;

Ford is in a position to do great things, while Farley &amp; Co. have improved the company, there is so much more to do that they are ignoring. Obviously, there are subjects I am not aware of, however, from what I've read through their presentation, Q1 report, and 10-Q, these are some things that should be done.

A wave of pessimism that has hurt  [Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA)  stock in recent days may be starting to recede. 

Stock in the [electric-vehicle](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-could-save-the-auto-business-by-disrupting-it-heres-how-51614442967?mod=article_inline)  pioneer was on its way to a fourth consecutive daily decline when the  shares turned around in midday trading Friday. Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.  

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock started out the week at about $729  and closed Monday at $738.20, ahead of the company’s first-quarter [earnings report](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-ticked-all-the-boxes-big-questions-remain-51619469933?mod=article_inline) that afternoon. Earnings were higher than Wall Street expected, but questions about the [quality](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-were-a-gift-to-doubters-a-fine-result-wasnt-good-enough-51619539342?mod=article_inline)  of the reported earnings—the degree to which trading in Bitcoin and  sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission cars lifted the  number–sent the stock lower. [Lingering concern](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-headline-headaches-wall-street-weighs-in-51619449789?mod=article_inline) over a recent crash of a Tesla vehicle in Texas dragged on the price too.  

The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  [S&amp;P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX)  and  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA), for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  

The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    

New Street Research analyst [Pierre Ferragu](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline) tweeted out Thursday that  [STMicroelectronics](https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM) (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. 

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  

Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. 

[Gary Black](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline), an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s [recent 10-Q](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline) quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        

Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. 

Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock."|investing|This Barron's article might explain Tesla's sudden surge today: Tesla Stock Turns Higher Because Sales and Deliveries May Blow Away Estimates|916.0|0.91

Getting completely lost in the current wild bull market is the fact that China's markets and economy have been starting to once again show cracks and signs of weakness. A lot of that is a product of the government starting to restrict their stimulus efforts in an attempt to keep the growth in debt and leverage in check. China has been the first market to really pull back stimulus, which probably isnt surprising since they were the first to be hit by and recover from Covid.

In the above linked article, there are some very.... interesting happenings relating to the Chinese property market. I don't for one second believe that China would ever purposefully burst their property bubble, since that would be a self-inflicted wound that would do a massive amount of damage.

That being said, as with any credit-fueled bubble, you tend to see these catch-22 situations pop up where regulators are forced to decide between:

1. Allowing the bubble to grow larger and larger, losing any type of control over how it behaves and worsening the fallout when the bubble inevitably bursts.
2. Clamping down on credit expansion, preventing the bubble from growing larger, but also risking being the pin that pops the bubble itself.

They seem to be going for option 2 right now. China recently tried to curb credit growth in 2018, and that played a major role in the markets that year, where both bonds and stock indexes saw a mild decline on the year. Despite the impact, China didn't even end up actually reducing the debt in the system, but just slowed the level of growth.... until Covid hit and the floodgates were once again reopened to credit growth.

Obviously, the thing to watch for is whether China can walk the tightrope of reducing leverage growth without triggering a cascading failure of the very fragile economy. One thing to keep in mind here is that China has greater ability to manage debt issues like this due to their economy not really being market-based, and the level of control the Gov't has over all the pieces in the puzzle. That's not to say that's all good - the ability to stall a forced deleveraging also means that the problems tend to metastasize quicker and to a far greater extent since the cans typically just get kicked down the road further. It's the classic moral hazard dilemma.

**Good Twitter Thread On This Article**

Quoting from Michael Pettis, who is always astute, and is a reasonably non-biased source on China's economy. [Read thread here](https://twitter.com/michaelxpettis/status/1387831939353153537).

&gt;""Important article by [@Birdyword](https://twitter.com/Birdyword/), who discusses the shift from bank loans to buyers' deposits in the liabilities of Chinese property developers. As usual I'm especially interested in the balance-sheet impact: as long as things are going well, the shift barely matters, but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.  
&gt;  
&gt;This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.  
&gt;  
&gt;This process can be highly self-reinforcing as it forces property developers to cut back further on operations, and so alienate even more deposits. Of course the more developers rely on deposits to fund their operations, the more likely it is that a problem with one large developer spreads to other developers around the country. Regulators can force banks to lend, but they can't force households to put up deposits.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, Beijing will have to choose either to let households take the loss or to force banks to step in and make them whole. The former seems politically unlikely, but the latter means that what had looked like a reduction in banks' exposure to real estate developers was never a meaningful reduction at all but rather the conversion of direct liabilities into contingent liabilities. For all the regulatory agitation, in other words, there was never an improvement in financial-sector risk.  
&gt;  
&gt;For many years we've seen that ""deleveraging"" in China has meant reducing leverage in one part of the economy while increasing it in another. This isn't incidental. It is fundamental to the way the growth model works. ""

**Some other general thoughts &amp; notes**

* The Shanghai Composite index is down 6% in RMB terms (ASHR etf is down 13% in US markets). In general, there has been emerging weakness in Chinese indexes compared to US stock indexes. Obviously this can reverse, but it's worth noting the divergence.
* The USDCNY exchange rate reversed in February for the first time since Covid hit in any meaningful way before starting it's fall again in recent weeks. Could be a sign that a durable trend reversal is coming, which tends to signal Chinese economic weakness from a market perspective.
* China has been putting curbs on developers for a little while now ( since end of 2020) due to excessive speculation &amp; credit growth - [read more here on some of the details](https://www.ft.com/content/5bdab1f8-3285-41ca-b964-bf3ce6b2c7fb)
* Chinese property is the primary means of savings for Chinese citizens.
* Beijing recently reduced restrictions on capital being allowed to leave their borders. This may potentially have an effect on property values and the exchange rate, although it's tough to say if and how much this will matter.

I think Apple is going to beat the market return by a significant margin over the long term. My Risk tolerance is high, so no diversification.. :)

For anyone wondering why the stock is down following blowout earnings like this, there are two main reasons:

1. Covid has given tremendous tail wind to the stock by boosting its Products and services revenue: People are working from home, on their devices longer than ever boosting the need to purchase new products and buy services. However, market is slightly worried this trend may reverse when world finally deals with Covid in upcoming 6 months to a year.
2. Sustainability of current growth: Iphone was a big driver for growth this year due to 5G Upgrades. But, this may slow down as more and more people upgrade to Iphone 12 family and hence when Iphone 13 (or 12s) comes out, the demand might not be so strong. The 2022 - 2023 demand for new Ipad/Mac/Wearables may also decrease as people use their devices less given opportunities for travel and recreation open up. So, again sustainability of this stellar growth is something that worries the market and market is pricing in the fact that next year numbers might show muted growth.
3. Chip shortages: Apple along with all other companies that use semiconductor chips in their machines are facing chip shortages. Apple's this Quarter was not impacted at all because of Supply buffers, but next Quarter onwards Apple might see 4-5 BN in lost revenue due to this external factor which it has little control over. Having said that, Apple has superb negotiating skills and Tim Cook is a Supply Chain guy himself, so I am sure, Apple will be fine on this front in the long term.

TLDR: Apple is an amazing growth machine but stock is still down after stellar Quarterly results due to concerns over Post Covid demand of products and services, Lower Iphone upgrades once majority upgrade to 5G, and Chip Shortages. The stock is pricing in these concerns, but over the long term, Apple has been and will reward its investors."|investing|Apple stock price reaction to stellar Quarterly earnings|2.0|0.53

The FDA Drug Approval Process can be broken down into 4 main sections: Pre-Clinical, Clinical Trials, Post Clinical, and Post Approval.

# Pre-Clinical

1. A drug's journey begins in the lab where researchers will look at thousands of compounds and eventually select a few that they believe are promising.
2. After gathering initial data on the compound the next step is further testing. This will be done either In Vitro (testing done in a petri dish/ test tube) or In Vivo (animal testing).
3. After successful testing, the pharmaceutical company will submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This includes all of the data gathered so far and a plan for testing the drugs on humans (clinical trials).
4. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND application and ensures human lives aren't at unreasonable risk. If the FDA accepts the IND, we move on to section 2 (Clinical Trials)

# Clinical trials

5) ***Phase 1*** studies consist of 20-100 **healthy volunteers** that last for **several months**. The exception being a drug used in cancer patients will be studied in patients with that type of cancer. The goal is to assess **safety** by monitoring how the drug affects the body as a whole, how long it lasts in the body, and any side effects that may appear. Results of **Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness**. I’ll repeat this because I believe it’s important: results of Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness. As of 2018, the FDA states roughly **70% of drugs will pass phase 1.**

6) ***Phase 2*** studies consist of **several hundreds of people with the disease/condition.** Studies here typically take **months- 2 years**. The goal here is to observe **effectiveness** of the drug in the intended patient population. This is where we first get to see if the drug truly works. Safety and side effects are monitored further as well. Approximately **33% pass phase 2.**

7) FDA and pharmaceutical company meet to discuss plans for large scale Phase 3 studies

8) ***Phase 3*** consists of **several** **thousands of participants**. These studies typically last **1-4 years.** The goal here is to continue to observe effectiveness and safety as well as seeing how different doses of the drug or in combination with other drugs affects the outcome. It is important to note that because the **studies are larger and for a longer duration, the results are more likely to show long term or less common side effects.** Should either happen, it almost always affects the stock negatively. **Approximately** **25-30% of drugs will pass Phase 3.**

# Post Clinical

9) The pharmaceutical company files a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA tells the FDA everything about the drug up to this point. This includes Pre-Clinical data, data from all clinical trials, as well as how the drug will be manufactured, and proposed labeling.

10) The FDA has 60 days to decide if they will accept the NDA or reject it. If accepted, the drug is now under FDA review by a review team. Each team member will review their particular portion of the NDA. For example, the medical officer reviews all clinical data, the pharmacologist reviews all Pre-Clinical data, a chemist evaluates the drug's chemical compound and stability, etc. If the NDA is rejected, the company and FDA will have to work together to resubmit a new NDA at a later date.

11) An inspection team is sent to the manufacturing site of where the drug will be made to assess for any issues that may affect the production of the drug.

12) After a thorough assessment of the reports from each review team member and the inspection team (**typically 6-10 months**), the FDA will either approve the drug or issue a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating the drug and the application cannot be approved in its current form. This isn’t the end of the drug’s journey however, a company can work with the FDA and resubmit a NDA.

# Post Approval

13) **Phase 4** Clinical trials (often referred to as post marketing surveillance trial). These are studies conducted in a large scale (thousands of people) to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval. The company is required to send periodic updates on safety and efficacy to the FDA.

Looking at some General Numbers

* · From start (Preclinical research) to finish (FDA approval) **a drug’s journey typically takes 10 years**
* · Some studies suggest the overall chance a drug gets approved is 10%. Other studies suggest 14%.
* · If we go by the FDA numbers, lets say we have 100 potential drugs. 70% will make it to phase 2. We now have 70 hopeful drugs and only 33% make it to phase 3. We now have 23 hopeful drugs and only 25% make it to pass phase 3. So now only 5-6 drugs have made it this far (5-6%).
* · These numbers don’t exactly match because certain drugs like say for your skin are easier to get approval than cancer drugs
* · Regardless of which approval percentage you go with, studies show 2 common themes: The **FDA drug approval percentage is low** and the drug **approval chance for cancer drugs is extremely low (usually around 3%). Also, fuck cancer.**

# In Summary

* Preclinical Trials: the company does lab research on the drug via petri dishes or animal testing. No humans yet.
* IND (Investigational New Drug) application is sent to FDA. If approved we move on to clinical trials
* Phase 1: small group of healthy volunteers. Goal to observe safety. Timeline several months. 70% pass rate
* Phase 2: medium sized group of people with the intended disease/condition. Goal to observe safety AND efficacy. Timeline months - 2 years. 33% pass rate.
* Phase 3: Large scale study for long duration. Goal to further assess safety and efficacy. Timeline 1-4 years. 25-30% pass rate.
* Company then files NDA and will undergo FDA review. Hopefully approval after that.
* Phase 4: Studies safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval and in a large population.
* From start to finish, drug’s typically take 10 years to make
* The overall approval chance for a drug is quite low (10-14%)
* Please please be careful/contain your excitement when you see positive Phase 1 results. It really doesn’t mean much.

Here's an overview of my performance since I started posting Stock Analysis to reddit: https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:F1rstxLas7. Any good investor heavily considers the underlying performance of a business before buying into them, so why shouldn't we do the same on reddit?

1-800-FLOWERS, or FLWS, just smashed their 3rd quarter earnings, so I wanted to write up a bit of due diligence on the company. In spirit of today's DD, here's: [a piece of digital art representing the Tulip bubble of the 1600's](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0564/6755/4489/files/TULIPScolorSHOP.jpg?v=1619009285). 

**Intro:** If you're unaware of 1-800-FLOWERS than you probably live in a cave where no sun shines and it's cold and lifeless, but I'll give you a pass because you probably also believe it's an over-the-phone floral delivery service. Good news, it's not. 1-800-FLOWERS is a leading e-commerce provider of products and services designed to inspire more human expression, connection, and celebration which today reported results for its Fiscal 2021 third quarter ended March 28, 2021. This colorful description comes from the marketing department so to give a better idea, it operates in three segments: Consumer Floral; Gourmet Foods &amp; Gift Baskets; and BloomNet. The company offers a range of products, including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, dipped berries, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candies, wine, and gift-quality fruits, as well as balloons, candles, keepsake gifts, jewelry, and plush stuffed animals. Alright, that's enough- use Google if you want to know more of the basics.


**Note:** This is a *cyclical* business. If it wasn't clear to you already, I'm going to state now that their quarterly results vary based on the celebrated holidays within their time frame. For example, in the year 2020, the quarters that ended in March &amp; September had roughly the same amount of Net Revenue but the quarter that ended in June had 1.5 times that amount. The Holiday season quarter ending in December *more than doubled* that very same quarter ending in June.

**Metrics:**

1.  ROIC, as of today for the TTM, is 19.66%. Over the last 5 years, starting at 8.11%, FLWS ROIC has steadily increased and is now more than twice it was only 5 years ago. (GuruFocus.com) ROA &amp; ROE are both also currently greater than 10%, but I'm not usually as focused on those metrics. (Finviz.com)
2. Institutional Ownership is 88%. In previous posts of mine, I've mentioned that I like seeing high enough IO to inspire confidence from the big guys, but a margin large enough to allow more big guys to come in and drive the price up with bulk buying. 88% is a great spot for Institutional Ownership. (Finviz.com)
3. D/E, as of prior to this most recent earnings report, is .34. I hate seeing debt, whether it be short or long term but the upside here is that FLWS has proven how to *make lending work for them.* At any rate, they are far from their own worst enemy, but here's the hot button topic that everyone is talking about: FLWS has a 27% Short ratio. As far as I'm concerned, this is *way* too high for such a strong business, but it's more important to note that this ratio is very likely based on cyclical, quarterly moves in the stock price. In my opinion, this is a risky, but fair short term trading strategy for a cyclical business like this. I believe, based on these fundamentals, that there's way too much risk betting against FLWS, even quarterly, but Hedgies gonna Hedge. (Finviz.com)
4. PEG Ratio was at .8 at market close yesterday for the next 5 years. For the *last* 5 years, EPS grew 24% *without* emphasis on their ecommerce business. This is with a P/E ratio of only 15, I mind you. With today's quarterly report, this is only going to get stronger. If you need me to spell this out, I will- their margins are only going to get stronger from here on out AND they're still undervalued. (Finviz.com)
5. Operating Cash Flow doubled from 2019 to 2020 and then *more than doubled* from 2020 to the TTM. (Yahoo Finance)
6. As of this morning, FLWS raised their share buyback program to $40 million. This management team knows what they're doing. They're taking full advantage of the shorting a cyclical business by purchasing their own shares when *they know* the price will be undervalued. All of this value comes right back to the shareholders for free. 

**Bear Case:** No company is perfect, so it's important for me to poke holes in any potential investment I'm considering. The bear case for 1-800-FLOWERS is consumer-centric. My research talking to people about the service and products have largely revolved around the same issue: Flower quality. Despite FLWS offering many different products and services, it appears that most people I have spoken to have felt somewhat disappointed by the flowers that have been delivered. In my own personal opinion when I have used the site for flower delivery, I did not experience the same- but again, that's just my own opinion. There were plenty of positive comments made about other offerings, but consumer sentiment is a piece of the puzzle when considering supporting a company, so I've taken this into account and will continue to monitor any changes.

**Subjective Analysis:** I think FLWS has what it takes to really bloom (sorry, I had to). A track record of a strong financial foundation, growth on the horizon by way of their Bloomnet and focus on their Ecommerce presence, and the ability to do all this with great margins and leadership team that *wants* shareholders to succeed.

“The commodity cost challenges we face this year will, obviously, be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care, and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that would go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid-to-high single digits.”

Honeywell

“And for us, inflation is taking hold. There is no doubt about it. We knew it. We see it, it's real. And if you don't stay on top of it, the two areas where -- and this is not a surprise. Steel, semiconductors, copper, ethylene, those are the four elements that we saw substantial inflation in Q1…. I don't think things are going to abate. The short cycle is definitely hard. We all read the same articles around semiconductors and what's going on there. And I think we're going to have to just stay ahead of it. But we do expect that inflationary environment this year and we're going to be to stay ahead of it.”

Kimberly Clark

“I'd like to start the call today with a few brief remarks. Our first quarter results and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, faster-than-expected consumer tissue de-stocking, and a sharp rise in input costs. While I'm not pleased with the results and our outlook, we're taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face.”

Coca-Cola

“… we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PET, metals and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners.”

PepsiCo

“In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now.”

Nestle

“I would like to caution against excessive margin growth expectations based on these strong sales growth. We now see broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Not all of these items can be hedged and our hedging cover for a number of commodities will run out over time. We are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there is a time lag associated with pricing.”

Danone

“When it comes to inflation, you're absolutely right to say that we have seen an accelerating inflation since the start of the year, which is impacting us, I would say, across the different ingredients, which is on milk, but also other dairy ingredients, on plastics, on sugar, but also, as I said, on logistics and transport. And we are reaching now a very strong mid-single digit level when it comes to inflation.”

Boston Beer

“On the freight, clearly, this is -- there's a factor that you probably have heard that on other calls in the industry. There's a real shortage of drivers and of trucks. So the ratio between available trucks and loads have significantly worsened. And that's what we see in the rate. To the point that we've broken it out really in the earnings release separately because the impact is significant. And it really depends, right. We have contracted rates, but then you don't get the truck and you have to go deeper into it. So we've seen the impact on multiple levels. One is the input costs are going up …it's coming into are our cost and materials and that's ingredients, the packaging materials. So we see it there.”

Celanese

“I mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think, the good news is, we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already and started moving prices in engineered materials to reflect this, and of course, that price ultimately still gets reflected more quickly. So although it is an inflationary pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing and basically maintain the same level of variable margin.”

Crown Holdings

“…we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sits around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time. So an increase of 70% and as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.”

Steel Dynamics

“Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs.”

Mattel

“We're not going to talk about specific pricing actions or timing. But we are evaluating price adjustments for the recent increases in input costs and I would also want to point out that despite the cost inflation we're it seeing and the impact it's having on gross margin.”

Whirlpool

“So while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.”

Snap-On

“Look -- yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you? Right. And so part of the thing is you got -- you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yes, we might see some, but we're not -- at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April, early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up.”

GATX Corporation

“…we buy cars both on the spot market and through our supply agreements that the majority of which is through the supply agreements. So certainly, the increased price of steel is increasing the cost of a car across the board.”

Dover Corporation

“I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation and it's not just a raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly at the assembly level on labor availability is becoming a problem and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from, it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs we ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not, it's more inbound logistics costs then it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because you're going to add. I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative.

Sonoco

“Our Industrial segment was hit the hardest with price/cost challenges, due to the higher OCC costs internationally as well as higher-than-expected inflation and operating costs like energy and freight.”

TE Connectivity

“Certainly, we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant and as we battle through there and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freights and so forth in terms of that and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been -- is well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of the year, we are seeing a little bit higher input costs, particularly with the resins and some of that pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then, the copper prices as we've continued to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. In some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost.”

Badger Meter

“I mean even Just in the first quarter, we saw the input cost go from $3.60 to today $4.20 and that's after March having been a relatively favorable change that obviously has been erased here in the month of April. So I think it's what we've been saying all along in terms of the continued price focus and the opportunity and the market acceptance of being able to pass some of those increases through in today's dynamics and in today's environment. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to do that to a degree that we're able to -- we believe we'll be able to offset the majority of the cost pressures.

I'm looking to get a valuation on FUBOTV based on my estimate Subs growth out to 2025. This is how I have approached it. Can I get some comments on this please as to is it a valid approach or not? Suggestions of alternates...

P/S(TTM) = 4 Stock Price is $22Current subs as of Dec 2020 - 545K - 41% growth

**Streaming Subscriptions**

Assume growth is at the same level for next 5 years:

Sub Dec 2021 - 770K -&gt; Sub Dec 2022 - 1.085M -&gt; Sub Dec 2023 - 1530M-&gt; Sub Dec 2024 - 2.16M-&gt; Sub Dec 2025 - **3.043M**

Assume we only get revenue at the base subscription level to be conservative:

$65 x 3M x 12 = $2.4B

**Online Sportsbook &amp; Fantasy Sports**

Draftkings reported $65 per unique monthly user in Q4 2020. They have 1.5 million of these. I am giving FUBO 1/3 of this per active users to be prudent as we just don't know yet what sort of money FUBO will bring in for Fantasy Sports and Sports Betting.

By 2025 with 3 Million users getting an estimated $22 on average per user per month

3m users x $22 x 12 months = $792M per annum

**Ad Revenue**

We assume FUBO can work the Ad Revenue to at least Hulu's level of 34%(Youtube is at 47%) of subscriber revenue by 2025

Subscriber Revenue in 2025 estimates as above at $2.4B \* 34% = $816M

**Total Revenue by 2025**

$2.4B + $0.792B + $0.816B = $4.008B

P/S(TTM) = 4 Assume it will double given growth(which is a conservative measure) to 8

Sales = $4B

Shares Outstanding = 140.16 million

P/4B=8

P=32B/140.16M

FUBO Price as of 2025 based on assumptions above = $228.31

Is this realistic to attempt a valuation going backwards on Price/Sale ratio?

I realize nobody can truly know what to expect, but I'm asking what assumption you would make based on historical norms, future outlook, macroeconomic factors, etc.


Personally, I assume a conservative rate of return of 7%. I do this for several reasons. First, I would rather underestimate how much I will have in 20 years and be pleasantly surprised when the return is more.

* Regulatory credits were 518 Million
* Gross margins expanded by 95 Basis points YoY to 26.5%

Some interesting things I noticed

* Tesla sold some Bitcoin and made a 101 Million gain. Elon Tweeted this about the sale

&gt;No, you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.

This seems like a bunch of BS and I think They just wanted to Massage earnings a little bit or take some profits.

* Elon can now vest his last two tranches.
* Elon stated that they faced problems due to chip shortages.
* Elon also predicted that Model Y will be the best selling Vehicle in 2022 or 2023

If two identical people had taken all of their disposable income and savings and one put it into SF property and the other SPY, who would have come out ahead?

For the sake of concreteness, lets say the one investing in SF Real Estate lived in the house, whereas the one investing in SPY paid an equal amount of rent to the Mortgage of the SF property, but without Property taxes.

I'll make this short - we all have seen the strong uptick in ""DD"" posts on this and every single other financial subreddit.  A significant portion of these posts are coming from either new users or suspicious accounts (extensive history posting porn, no prior engagement in financial subs, etc).  It's our understanding that a significant portion of these posts are the result of interested third parties compensating people to raise visibility of a stock on Reddit.  

-----

**Effective immediately, we are implementing the following guidelines:**

DD (Due Diligence) posts, for purposes below, are any long form posts reporting on specific stocks.  Special attention to anything between a 500M and 10B Market cap, as that's where we've seen a lot of this activity.

**1) If a user is posting their DD post across multiple subreddits it's going to be removed from here.** 

**2) If a DD post is coming from a new user, or one with little to no history participating in any investment/finance subs it's probably going to get removed**

**3) DD posts must include a legitimate bear case, not lip service to risks, but a genuine examination of risks and adverse outcomes.  It must also include actual financials - cashflows, balance sheet items, etc.**  You don't need to do a full valuation model like you're an analyst, but you do need to discuss the actual financials of the stock. 

Ultimately this is just a framework - because much of the interpretation of intent here is subjective the mods may still remove a DD post on a given stock if things just feel wrong.  I think the constraints on who can post DD should be sufficient to prevent much of the spam/shill type DD posts we've been seeing.

------

**In addition I'm working on an automod sticky that would replace our normal new thread sticky** - this would warn users that DD posts are not to be taken at face value, and that the potential for misleading statements about a security to be made on Reddit is quite high. 

We chatted a bit over this and the above requirements are where we landed, we're still open to feedback or suggestions - the ultimate goal isn't to prevent people from talking about stocks they're interested in - it's to prevent bad actors from utilizing reddit to drive interest in stocks they may have financial interest in.    

People are still free to make discussion posts on a given stock, but those should at least show that you've done a starting bit of research on the stock.  But we won't scrutinize something like ""what are your thougts on XYZ, here's what I came across"" nearly as much as ""Full review on this 2B mkt cap generic chapstick manufacturer, it's set to explode"".  Ultimately this shouldn't impact anyone looking to just chat stocks in good faith - we're only aiming to get rid of a lot of these super suspicious posts that have popped up post GME.     

Unrelated: We've eased up the automod constraints on advice/beginner posts to hopefully encourage more complex questions to come through."|investing|New guidelines for DD posts|174.0|0.95

Here are some examples of popular on-chain metrics.

* [Liquid supply change](https://i.imgur.com/HyiWBaK.png) - supply in wallet addresses that has not been moved for at least 6 months

* [Exchanges net transfer](https://imgur.com/sI5uIDg) - coins moving on or off exchanges - indicative of available liquidity and market depth (amount needed to move price)

* [Coinbase Pro outflows](https://imgur.com/7qirkoL) - outflows usually mean movement to cold storage for long term holding, inflows can signal desire to sell, Coinbase Pro is of particular interest because of institutional usage

* [Accumulation addresses](https://i.imgur.com/KvIoeOp.png) - Bitcoin addresses that have received at least two transactions but have never spent funds, 'black hole' addresses

* [Bitcoin miner net position change](https://i.imgur.com/z1syaVo.png) - miners net selling or holding new coins

* [UTXO realized price distribution](https://i.imgur.com/5zrvlia.png) - amount of volume traded at each price level, sometimes used to infer resistance levels

The unprecedented transparency is one of the under-appreciated aspects of crypto markets. The information asymmetries we've seen in the stock or precious metals market and economic data are much lower. 

Instead of speculating on the status of a commodity squeeze like silver crypto traders can visualize one developing second by second with high precision. You can see if retail (minnows) or institutions (whales) are buying or selling. Whether old OG holders are cashing out or stacking more. Whether network activity is increasing, etc. 

In equities this level of data would often only be available if you worked in the company. It's another toolset for people who already use TA and use macroeconomic indicators. 

You can access data through [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/), [Santiment](https://santiment.net/) (also has off-chain sentiment data), [Cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com/), [Woobull](http://charts.woobull.com/). 

Resources for using on-chain data are [Glassnode Academy](https://academy.glassnode.com/), [Glassnode Insights](https://insights.glassnode.com/) newsletter, Santiment [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzP_Z3MrygWlbLMyrNmMkg) channel, on-chain analysts [1](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII) [2](https://twitter.com/woonomic), and any interview with [Willy Woo](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=willy+woo). This is the best way to learn the context behind each metric. 

Analyzing the flows, supply changes, accumulation patterns, etc is helpful in forming and sticking to an investment thesis in an asset class that is notoriously unpredictable, whether your goal is to hold or attempt to trade the [cycle](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) top."|investing|Introduction to on-chain data analysis for blockchains|67.0|0.82

**Opinion** (Ignore this)

I think this seems like a business about to finally turn the corner and become a cash flow machine. The growth figures are really great and they are starting to generate some cashflows. It is still very expensive but at present it is kinda justifying it price with great numbers. At current prices it is trading at 46X Sales. It will need to continue growing at this rate for a few more years to justify it's price.

- - - - - - - -

Chris Cole released a paper last year called ""The Allegory of the Hawk and the Serpent."" The paper detailed how investors could protect and build their wealth over a 100 year period. If you haven't read the paper, I would highly recommend doing so [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi95qub1ZXwAhVTHM0KHU7QDQMQFjAAegQIAxAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrovoices.com%2Fguest-content%2Flist-guest-publications%2F3502-the-allegory-of-the-hawk-and-serpent%2Ffile&amp;usg=AOvVaw1RpaeVw0O4wF4dO4MIpgs5). In it, he details how our idea of ideal portfolio construction has been warped by the last 40 years, namely an environment where interest rates have been falling. This has lead most investment advisors to recommend a stock/bond portfolio. This is also known as the 60/40 portfolio. 

The idea behind the 60/40 portfolio is that stocks and bonds are  anti-correlated, meaning when stocks go up, bonds go down and visa versa. This allows the investor to grow their wealth over time without major drawdowns. Avoiding major drawdowns is key in any portfolio construction. The issues arise when you start looking at periods beyond the early 80s. This was the time interest rates peaked, and they have been falling ever since. One of the question Chris Cole asks is ""how would this portfolio perform over 100 years?"" The answer is poorly. For two separate decades (the 30s and the 70s), this portfolio would have had significant drawdowns. Why? Because during these periods, stocks and bonds were positively correlated. Stocks and bonds moved up and down together. 

What is Chris Cole's solution? He calls it the Dragon Portfolio. A portfolio that has elements beyond those of stocks and bonds. He recommends the following allocation:

* 20% Gold
* 20% Long Equity
* 20% Low Risk Long Duration Bonds
* 20% Commodity Trend
* 20% Long Volatility

Not only does this portfolio perform well during periods like the 30s or 70s, but it also outperforms the traditional advice during the good decades. the portfolio also outperforms during good periods. Over the last 40 years, the Dragon Portfolio has an annualized rate of return of 10.1% while the 60/40 portfolio only returns 3.9% during the same period.

For the retail investor, the first three elements are easy enough for the average investor to achieve. Simply invest in GLD, TLT and the equity index of your choice. Commodity trend is doable as well. Use a simple trend following system allocated to a basket of commodities. You could do a 40-50 day cross over on a broad commodity etf like DJP or GNR. However, Long Volatility proves trickier. Most investors don't know how to go long volatility beyond buying the VXX etf. Unfortunately, the carry cost makes this untenable. Take a look at the VXX chart over a five year time horizon. This thing is consistently melting down. Here is where Chris Cole makes his pitch. He offers professionally managed Long Volatility funds that fit into the Dragon Portfolio. Only downside is you must be a ""Qualified Investor."" Yes, qualified, not accredited. IE your net worth needs to be over 5 million dollars to even have a conversation about his products. 

Needless to say, the average retail investor does not have this net worth or else he'd be lying on a beach after telling his boss to shove it. My goal is to test a simple long volatility strategy in combination with the other elements of the Dragon Portfolio to see if the average retail investor can invest using Chris Cole's methodology. To do this, I opened up a paper trading account with $100,000 and will be tracking this portfolio on a weekly basis. I broke down the allocations as follows:

* 20% GLD - Gold ETF
* 20% TLT - Long Duration US Government Bonds
* 20% RSP - Equal weight S&amp;P 500. This tends to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over time by about 1-2% per year
* 20% DJP - Long Bloomberg commodity index. Commodities are in an uptrend right now. I may change this to GNR.
* 1% IWM 90 day Long Straddle (rolling every 30 days) - Long Volatility representing long/short 100 shares of the Russell 2000. 

You might be wondering why I am doing the Russell 2000 straddle. Two reasons. First, the straddle is the definition long volatility. You are long a call and a put while betting the value of either leg will go further than the implied price represents. Chris Cole mentions in an interview on MacroVoices this is the broad outline for the long volatility component he uses. Second, the IWM is a small enough ETF that a $100,000 account can have 20% represented by a single put and call contract. We aren't trying to leverage this portion to the hilt. We are trying to keep the theta burn small enough that when a big risk on or risk off event happens, the straddle spikes up. The goal is to have anti-correlated assets classes.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/25913Hp) are my current allocations. I'll be posting updates every week and comparing the performance to a 60/40 portfolio as well as a long equity portfolio (100/0) to see how they perform. 

I would appreciate any feedback or advice on the strategy."|investing|The 100 Year Portfolio: A Look at Using the Dragon Portfolio as a Retail Investor|501.0|0.9
1619218741.0|0.0|t3_mx7aye|15.0|"The southern US is growing much faster than the rest of the US, especially places like the Phoenix MSA and Texas Triangle. Of the top 10 most populous cities in the US, the only four that have experienced more than 10% population growth in the past decade have been in Texas and Arizona. Austin in particular (#11th most populous US city) grew 24% in the past decade and is probably the hottest real estate market in the US right now. Anyone who lives in these areas, especially Texas, knows how how many people from places like California are going to Texas for cheaper CoL amongst other things. I'd provide links but I'm not sure if they'd get my post deleted by AutoMod - city/state growth is readily available.

That being said, real estate is the most obvious investment opportunity to profit off of this demographic shift. My only exposure to real estate as a 25 year old just starting my career is FundRise and REITs - FundRise has a clear focus on southern real estate, especially in TX, and with enough research you can find REITs (like MAA, CPT, BRT) that invest primarily in the sunbelt region.

Other ideas I've had are power/utilities companies like PNW. One might even combine this demographic perspective with climate change speculation - people are moving to hot places that are going to keep getting hotter; air conditioning stocks like CARR may be a good choice?

So form my perspective, I can only really think REITs/utilities/AC. I wanted to give my own two cents on how to profit off of this growth but also see if people here had other ideas as to specific sectors or stocks (or non-stock market ideas) and spark discussion. I'm also curious if people here have ideas for investing in other demographic trends such as aging population."|investing|Ideas for investing in growth in the sunbelt|15.0|0.7

1619201124.0|0.0|t3_mx1aby|163.0|"After a fly-by-night post a few days ago said Alteryx was a buy, I decided to do some DD. I've wanted to for awhile, at the time of this writing I owned AYX (buying ~$70 back in 2019) and it seemed like the stock could do no wrong as it exploded to ATHs (~$178) in Mid-2020. However, it's currently trading at $84 and the question is, is this a dip worth buying or is it finally time to cut off my AYX position? Personally, I've disliked the product when I've seen it and dislike their lack of R&amp;D. When they become ""old"" feeling, I don't think they'll survive. I think they may already be at that point. Also, I heard a rumor but don't want to make it seem bigger than it is so I'll be adding some hypotheticals below.

**Disclaimer:** After doing this research I no longer hold any position in AYX.

**R/Investing TLDR:** I've already sold my AYX shares

**R/WSB Risky TLDR:** and will take a short position (buying puts for post earnings and after next quarter's earnings)

Most of my numbers come from [their most recent 10-K](https://investor.alteryx.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx).

**Bull case:**

AYX is growing. Their ""dollar based net expansion"" rate is above 100% at 122%, which fits comfortably around [the Docusign/Cloudflare zone](https://softwareequity.com/the-impact-of-net-retention-on-valuation-for-public-saas-companies/). Not bad.  However, this metric has been shrinking for 2 years now and if anything, it shows they don't know how to improve this metric any longer. They've dropped 1-2% per quarter every quarter for 2 whole years. Because they do trailing 4 quarters, it's actually lower than 122% right this moment but we don't know exactly how much.

They have nice case studies. They have grown customers up to 7083 customers, and revenue to $495.3M (+18.5%). Guidance for ARR is $555-565M for this year. Their margins are awesome at 91%.

**Bear case:**

The co-founder stepped down to [bring on a new CEO](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alteryx-ayx-appoints-new-ceo-raises-q3-top-line-outlook-2020-10-06). This is typically something you'd do when your company was at a new stage of it's life. That stage is sometimes ""fuck R&amp;D, just increase sales/marketing and get this to as many companies as possible."" I think that's where we are, and I'll show it below.

Additionally, the new CEO had to [instantly fire the CRO for offensive tweets](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3664513-alteryx-shares-drop-after-chief-revenue-officer-resigns).

Now I'm going to get into the real meat. What started this whole thing? The rumor I heard is that some larger companies aren't interested in renewing anymore, and I think we've seen that already in the numbers. I'll do some analysis below but the main question is: do you think this is a huge signal that other companies are starting to drop AYX, or is this just a temporary blip and the new CEO is going to come up with new valuable solutions? Based on the middling CEO above, and the lack of R&amp;D that I'll highlight below, my thought is AYX is going to have trouble retaining customers moving forward.

The strategy straight from their 10k is:

* ""to increase our current customer base of approximately 7,100 customers through an active “land and expand” strategy."" Cool, but that means they need to both land AND keep in order to expand.

Their revenue is growing, but if you look at their subscription revenue only, it's only growing by 3%, compared to their other services growing 37%. That means most of their revenue growth isn't new contracts or customers or even added users within contracts, it's added services. These services have an 85% margin so I expect their 91% margins to start to drop. I'm much more concerned with their actual growth looking to be closer to 3% in subscription revenue. That 3% number has been **dropping** every year!

* ""We plan to expand our online and offline marketing efforts to increase demand for our platform and awareness of our brand. We also plan to continue to invest in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels."" Boo. I don't think they're to that point as a company yet, yet their numbers show that they are definitely spending most of their money on marketing/sales. Currently, 51% of their expenses are spent on marketing. In fact, R&amp;D has been the smallest part of their expenses every year since they went public. That doesn't make sense to me. This is a personal feeling but it feels like they're not continuing to develop what customers may need in the future.

* ""with  an increased  focus  on Global  2000 companies"" Here's the big one. In their 10k they specify that they have ~750 of the top 2000 companies, and that this is their strategy going forward. What if those big customers start to drop off?

If my thesis is true that big companies don't quite jive with AYX and may start leaving or shrinking their contracts, this could be really bad for AYX especially since it's their top focus.

AYX charges $5195/user/year for designers and $2100/user/year for others. The average contract value is hard to pinpoint, but we can look through the years at a few analyses and one of my own. From the S1 in 2017, [an analyst](https://medium.com/@alexfclayton/alteryx-s-1-breakdown-4a711683f6c) stated that annual contract value was $40.7K. In 2019, [another analyst](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdefrancesco/2019/04/24/alteryx-empowers-customers-to-turn-data-into-actionable-insights/?sh=2951aedd4690) said a typical new customer comes in at an average deal size of $10,000-$11,000.  If we just divide revenue by customers we get $70k/customer.  However, larger customers are obviously larger since they pay per user. In 2020, [another analyst](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/29/why-alteryx-focusing-large-companies-fuel-growth.aspx) said that 33% of their revenue is from the Global 2000, so using the 750 number from their 10k that gets us to $220k/customer.

However this quote gives us a better baseline for a top customer of AYX: ""Last year, the number of customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $1 million more than doubled, while the number of transactions worth more than $500,000 tripled."" The biggest customers are probably worth at least $1M if not more.

Finally though, what if one of the really really big customers leave (going back to my rumor)? Someone with multiple teams adding up to 1000 analysts? Using the S1 link above, at the time they stated ""no customer had **more than** 10% of their total revenue."" That probably means that at least one customer **DID** have up to 10% of their total revenue. If that's the case, that huge contract could have been worth **$3.7M** based on revenue at that time (years ago), and it could be worth more now.

I want to check that figure: Let's say a major company has ~14k corporate workers, maybe 10% of them max would be analysts or desire access to those tools. Some of them would be normal users while some would be design users. Using some rough assumptions, 9% * 14k * $2100 + 1% * 14k * $5195 would be around $3.3M.  I think the $3.7M ARR figure is at least reasonable for a large customer.

Finally, the average contract length is 2 years for an AYX customer. A lot of the big companies are coming up on contract renewal decisions. One point against this is: I've searched major companies job postings with ""Alteryx"" in the description, and a lot of them still exist.


**Bottom line:** what would happen if a large, $3.7M ARR contract left AYX tomorrow? Not that much by itself.

But, if you believe it's a signal for other large companies to do the same, and you don't think they have enough new customer revenue (maybe ~3% and dropping each year?) to make up for it, and their expansion/service revenue is higher cost/lower margin, and their R&amp;D won't save them because they haven't focused on it enough, then this is bad for AYX.

If you think it's just one company and doesn't matter because its a rumor, then this is your time to buy.

I think it's a signal that things are about to get worse for AYX and I've already sold my shares."|investing|My Alteryx (AYX) DD: This isn't a dip to buy, it's part of their long decline.|163.0|0.89
1619189538.0|0.0|t3_mwx0rd|24.0|"The green revolution is upon us. Enbridge is a critical energy infrastructure business known for transporting oil and natural gas. It also has a sizeable renewable segment. What you might not be aware of is how well that stacks up in the renewables space and how such companies are including non-renewable power in their total outputs.

For capacity context, the International Renewable Energy Agency released its [2020 Renewable Capacity Statistics ](https://www.irena.org/publications/2021/March/Renewable-Capacity-Statistics-2021)which provides insights into the sector as a whole.

 I have ranked Enbridge with various renewable companies in terms of **current net capacity** (the maximum output of electricity a generator can produce under ideal conditions) **minus natural gas capacity,** which[ according to the International Renewable Energy Agency is an alternative fossil fuel. ](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2018/Apr/IRENA_Report_GET_2018.pdf)Definitions for what constitute *renewable* natural gas vary and you will see further examples below, but this number is included where available. The only outputs considered are strictly renewable: solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal power. I have not included energy generation statistics (how much energy is actually output) because this varies based on operating capacity and conditions (eg. weather events will lower output).  


All data has been sourced from the latest publicly available ESG or Annual Reports and provided below. 

 

|**Company**|**Net Renewable Capacity (MW)**|
|:-|:-|
|Brookfield Renewable|18,884|
|Innergex Renewable|2,742|
|Boralex|2,455|
|Enbridge|1,727|
|Algonquin|1,456|
|Northland Power|1,323|
|Transalta Renewables|1,619\*\*|

\*\* \*\*Transalta Renewables as at Dec 31 2020 listed only gross renewable MW and not net, which is significantly lower. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **Brookfield Renewable:** by far the largest output capacity and zero natural gas facilities. The majority of net capacity comes from Hydro and Wind. 

 **Innergex Renewable:** The majority of net capacity comes from Wind and Hydro. Again no natural gas. 

 **Boralex:** 82% of net capacity is derived from Wind. Least diversified of the group. 

 **Enbridge:** Majority of renewable capacity generated by Wind. Renewables represent 3% of EBITDA and appx. $200MM in annual contracted revenues. 

 Combined Current Renewable Power Generation outputs:  
• 1,392 MW is generated by North American wind facilities;  
• 255 MW is generated by European offshore wind facilities;  
• 80 MW is generated by North American solar facilities in operation 

 **Algonquin**: The latest data from 2021 sources showed FY19 figures. You will see coal listed here: the Asbury coal plant was closed in March 2020. Furthermore, a significant portion of their capacity is from natural gas (50%), which is from non-renewable sources and thus not included. 

 **Northland Power:** Included in their total output is ‘efficient’ natural gas, which accounts for \~60% of net capacity. While the outcome is reduced emissions, it is still not a renewable source and therefore not included in total renewable capacity. 

 **Transalta Renewables:** Similar to Algonquin and Northland, a significant portion of capacity is from natural gas (\~60%). I was unable to find updated net capacity statistics, which are significantly lower than gross, thus TA ranked last. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Net capacity is an important metric in measuring where a renewable company stands, but it is not the only one. Revenues are impacted by total output and pricing, of which the weather events in Texas provided an eye-opening example. Nevertheless, what we see from the above comparison is that Enbridge is already well positioned amongst common North American “renewable” names, albeit far behind big players like Brookfield. Looking through the above company ESG and Annual Reports highlighted further forays into traditional renewable sources, while also noting investments in **renewable natural gas**. Let’s not forget the critical role Enbridge will play in RNG transmission alongside their [own RNG production.](https://www.enbridgegas.com/Natural-Gas-and-the-Environment/Enbridge-A-Green-Future/Renewable-Natural-Gas) 

 Make of this information what you will. The market is currently discounting their business with the secular oil decline, and not fully considering Enbridge’s ability to innovate and partner alongside a growing global energy infrastructure network, particularly in the NG/RNG space. I am bullish.

The narrative yesterday was that stocks fell on fears of substantially higher capital gains tax on incomes over $1M annually. Certainly, that makes stocks a less attractive investment for high income investors because it hurts their risk/return profile. But, if they're selling stocks to move assets elsewhere, that creates an opportunity for the rest of us, right? 

After all, the expected future free cash flows of the underlying businesses haven't changed, right? So if valuations are unchanged, but prices are lower, that is a buying opportunity. Perhaps one could argue that the lower investment incentive (for high earners) could hurt the economy as a whole? And thus that mechanism is weighing on stocks and actually hurting business valuations? That's a little different narrative than the one we're hearing right now though.

I realize a 1% drop is pretty trivial, but if the Biden plan moves forward and looks like it will pass (or does pass), we could see more price movement on the same fears.

Alda Leu Dennis, a general partner at Initialized Capital, says it’s in part because of the lack of women VCs. 

In 2020, VC funding for all-female founding teams fell to 2.4%, a drop from the all-time high of 3.4% the year before, according to Crunchbase. Dennis, meanwhile, is investing in startups that could narrow the gender gap, many of which are FamTech (family tech) companies, designed to improve family life — something many of us have gotten plenty of during lockdown.

Before Initialized, Dennis was a managing partner at 137 Ventures, investing in startups like Wish, Coupang, and CourseHero. She broke into venture capital by way of law (with a stint as a CEO), serving as general counsel at Founders Fund, and assistant general counsel at Clarium Capital Management, working with Peter Thiel.

One reason is that we often get posts from bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. This morning - an account which only posted porn in the past to collect karma suddenly starts to post investing advice and stock recommendations.

One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.

Jaguar Land Rover is to temporarily shut down production at two of its main UK factories because of a shortage of computer chips, in the latest sign of the difficulties facing the global car industry during the pandemic.

It is understood the shutdown is scheduled to last at least a week, although the company will continue to monitor its chip supply before committing to a reopening date.

The automotive industry is used to running lean “just-in-time” supply chains that minimise the amount of cash tied up in factory warehouses. However, the global nature of the chip shortage has strained carmakers as they compete directly with tech companies for supply.

&gt; Apple will expand its advertising business, according to two people familiar with its plans, just as it brings in new privacy rules for iPhones that are likely to cripple the ads offered by its rivals, including Facebook.


&gt;The iPhone maker already sells search ads for its App Store that allow developers to pay for the top result. In searches for “Twitter”, for example, the first result is currently TikTok.


&gt;Apple now plans to add a second advertising slot, in the “suggested” apps section in its App Store search page. This new slot will be rolled out by the end of the month, according to one of the people, and will allow advertisers to promote their apps across the whole network, rather than in response to specific searches.


&gt;Apple declined to comment.


&gt;The expansion is the first concrete sign that Apple plans to enhance its own advertising business at the same time as it shakes up the broader $350bn digital ads industry led by Facebook and Google.


&gt;Apple’s forthcoming software update, iOS 14.5, will ban apps and advertisers from collecting data about iPhone users without their explicit consent. Most users are expected to decline to be tracked, dealing a huge blow to how the mobile advertising industry works.


&gt;Apple has said the changes will improve the privacy of its users, but some critics have accused the company of hoping to boost its own fledgling advertising business. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, said: “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track with their competitive interests.”


&gt;Apple has long wanted to be a big player in mobile advertising. In 2010, it paid $275m to acquire Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company, after being beaten by Google in the bidding for $750m AdMob.


&gt;The same year, it launched iAd, a multiyear effort to build an advertising business.


&gt;At launch, iAd had a minimum contract price of $1m, but within a year it had cut the requirement by half. Apple tried to maintain creative control of ads and was reticent to share user data with marketers, according to analysts at Bernstein. Two years later Apple cut the minimum contract to just $50 and the whole effort was shut down in early 2016.


&gt;Meanwhile, the market for online advertising has boomed, with annual sales of $378bn, according to the market research group Insider Intelligence.


&gt;Google and Facebook are the two biggest players in the market, but Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has repeatedly attacked their business models as unsustainable because of how they accumulate large troves of data to target their ads.


&gt;Bernstein estimated that Apple currently earns around $2bn a year from search ads in the App Store, with 80 per cent margins. Apple also sells ads in its Stocks and News apps.


&gt;A second advertising slot in the App Store is likely to appeal to advertisers after the iPhone’s privacy changes reduce the effectiveness of targeted ads. But there is more than money at stake, according to Eric Seufert, a mobile advertising expert.


&gt;A decade ago, the App Store played a critical role in how consumers discovered new content. Seufert told the tech site Stratechery earlier this year that Apple used to be “king maker — if you got featured, your company valuation might increase by a hundred million dollars.”


&gt;He suggested that Apple now wishes to regain this level of control. “If Apple cripples mobile advertising, then the App Store becomes the primary discovery point for apps again, and Apple decides how people use our iPhones, Apple decides which apps are the most popular,” he said."|investing|Apple to boost ads business as iPhone changes hurt Facebook|1029.0|0.92

I’ve been trying to figure out what to do with investing as Graham defines it (as opposed to speculating) and the current situation with bond yields with his advice that you should keep at least 25% allocated because of the potential for things to change in the future. 

I’ve also been a fan of Ray Dalio’s advice, and recently read his post on avoiding bonds altogether.(https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-world-would-you-own-bonds-when-ray-dalio)

These two thought streams are seemingly at odds, and the best I can come up with is that Graham’s advice didn’t take into account such low bond yields ever existing, and I’m probably better off following Dalio’s advice:

“ I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets. I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital controls.”

I’ve gotten rid of bond ETFs completely from my portfolio, and now have some gold, emerging Asia markets, commodities, foreign value ETFs to replace them.

I’d love to hear all of your thoughts on both reconciling Graham’s investment approach with current bond yields and on Dalio’s thoughts. What do you think?"|investing|Reconciling the Intelligent Investor with Current Bond yields.|122.0|0.93

Firstly - I am an existing shareholder, own around 900 shares with an average buy price of $34 (so I am down on this... but in the current market, who isn't). KARO are a leading global provider of vehicle telematics. The proprietary in-house technology provides the best intelligent, actionable data to fleet operators and security for all vehicle owners - across 23 countries over 5 continents. Most interesting areas of the business to me are their AI Video &amp; Fleet Telematics, along with how they use their data to sell used cars and insurance in the future. I am impressed that they seem to keep developing the business, whilst maintaining a very healthy 15% margin.

* KARO is a holding company, the actual company is Cartrack
* 1.3m subscribers with 50 billion data points each month - data provides KARO with a huge opportunity for growth
* Business has continued strong growth through Covid (16% compared to 22% CAGR previously), expected rate is 26% for future years
* Free cash flow around 25%
* Prior to delisting from JSE, to list on NASDAQ and then do an inwards investment back onto the JSE - the stock price hit $629, with a share consolidation taking place at 10:1 - giving at all time high of $62.90 per share. Typically South African investment is more conservative that US/EU investors - who are more accepting of potential earnings forming part of the share price.
* Price to earnings is 28x - which is low in their industry, with the average being around 53x

What does KARO currently offer?

B2B - known as 'My Fleet' - Live Vision to make sure the driver is concentrating and not on their phone, insurance telematics, fleet management and optimisation, stolen vehicle recovery and fleet administration services. All services typically outsourced, not many companies I know of will invest in developing this tech themselves which is good for Karo.

B2C - known as 'My Car' - Vehicle protector, stolen vehicle recover (with promise to customer), crash alert to emergency services and insurance telematics.

**Customer Profile**

**South Africa -** De Beers, MAN, Avis, SA Taxi, Super Sport, Hino and many more - company originates from SA and very strong YOY performance here.

**Rest of Africa** \- Toyota, Cat, Moove and NCBA

**Europe** \- LaFarge, Telefurgo, Green Galaxy and Sonae MC

**Asia** \- Singapore Prison Service, ORIX, Grab Rentals &amp; Asia Brewery

Lots more to list - company has accounts open in the UK and US - with very small amounts of trade at the moment, but they have a track record of aggressive expansion whilst maintaining margins.

**Financials (Converted from ZAR to USD... took a while, so apologies if you spot any errors)**

Without doubt my favourite part of this company, extremely strong performer and growth looks very positive, with sufficient results to back up projections.

Low Debt - $1.2m

Total Cash - $7m

Free Cash Flow Margin - 25%

Total Assets - $140m

Total Liabilities - $56m

Debt Coverage - Well covered by operating cash flow (2019%)

Gross Margin - 71%

Revenue - $167m (c.4.5x market cap)

Earnings - $27.7m (roughly 15% margin &amp; 28x market cap - industry average listed on Nasdaq is c.50x)

I will post a link to their IPO pack in the comments section - I have looked at the financials over and over, **I really struggle to see any negatives but if you find any, please can you leave a comment as I want to keep educating myself.**

**Bull Case - Top 4 Points**

Aggressive, rapid and consistent CAGR - in the 20% range. I absolutely love this, I know I'm down right now but my price target to exit this stock is around $45 as a low estimate. Even with the market performing badly, I am not worried about my investment here. It isn't speculative, they are delivering.

Big data - its been big for a long time, I'm convinced it will continue to be big in the future. They already generate 50 billion data points a month from their existing contracts. They are looking to get further integrated with the insurance market and second hand car sales. Knowing how people drive through their current offerings is going to be huge in selling products that instantly fit with the consumers goals. If they drive fast... maybe upsell the car and have an insurance package wrapped up to help seal the deal. If they are more conservative drivers but have a powerful car, sell something more appropriate. I think this is a major opportunity for the business.

The world is going to see more crime, insurance premiums are rising, people want more protection and Karo offer a service that fills this space. Yes, there is telematics competition but in the nicest possible way car theft in the regions they currently operate in is pretty high and in regions that they don't yet operate in. Factor this alongside how much crime will increase in a post covid world (due to poverty increasing), I think that their CAGR of 26% will be achieved. Rich get richer... poor get poorer etc, its sad but generally true. Those with money will want to protect their valued assets without risking their own personal wellbeing.

Businesses need what Karo are selling. Whether its AI controlled systems or human, fleet management want 99% plus optimisation, with Karo's growth and products on offer, they simply must be offering a high quality product. Live vision &amp; fleet tracking is something I can see growing more and more. I know from personal experience of having to deal with a particularly painful Brexit, this would have been a life saver had all the fleet been managed in this way and could be traced at a click of a button. Integrated supply chains rely on this real time data, which to my disbelief doesn't currently exist throughout the world. Note - biggest single customer represents less than 2% revenue, so they are heavily diversified.

**Bear Case - Top 4 Points**

No major contracts in USA, Germany, France or UK. I don't know why, maybe it isn't in their strategy right now, but I'd really like to see them get a big contract in one of these regions. I'm sure it will come but it isn't there right now and although they may well do well in China - the markets I mention are strong and relatively stable compared to South Africa and current countries that they operate in.

Volume - its pretty low, the good news is... its a buyers market - the spreads aren't great, so would only enter with a limit order if you did decide to invest, be patient and I'd say no real need to click the ask button right now.

Competition - there is clear competition in the telematics industry, I'm not even going to try and counter this as its a basic fact. I have based my investment on the numbers I see in their investor pack, only you can decide whether these numbers are suitable for your investment and offer competitive value against other investment opportunities.

The number of risks listed in their SEC prospectus filing was pretty crazy - my positive spin on this is that they are aware of their risks, honest about them and have strategies to counter/mitigate against them. I'll post the link so you can check this out too, but please do before making a decision on whether to invest.

**Share Structure**

Relatively simple section - NASDAQ is the priority listing, total of c.21,000,000 shares - 20,000,000 held by insiders with a 180 day lock up. 9,000,000 listed on the JSE as in inwards listing.

Cartrack (KARO) used to be listed solely on the JSE - but due to expansion plans, has now listed on Nasdaq... it was listed the same day as UTME and genuinely believe a lot of investors missed this IPO due to the hype and price increase on UTME.

The company was previously valued at over $1 billion on the JSE and the CEO didn't sell any shares, as he went on record to say that he felt the company was worth at least $1.5 billion.

**Key Catalysts**

Earnings are due soon - I have spoken to their Investor Relations team and expected first week of May. I'm expecting that these are positive.

Covid risk lowering, more people returning to normal - cars left unattended in public places, more travel, more collisions, insurance going up and people using telematics to help reduce the total cost of car ownership.

The CEO has previously discussed how he believes cars will not be owned by individuals in the future and more fleet management will be required to make sure those in charge of a vehicle are driving responsibly. A lot depends on whether you share the same vision.

The streaming giant did beat financial targets, though with earnings per share of $3.75 coming in well ahead of Wall Street analysts’ expectations. Revenue of $7.16 billion also topped the Street.


The subscriber shortfall, which caused the stock to drop more than 10% in after-hours trading, was blamed on issues related to the coronavirus. Simply put, the pandemic gaveth, but also taketh away. “We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. “We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup.”


Net cash from operations surged to $777 million in the quarter from $260 million and free cash flow of $692 million was up from $162 million. Netflix confirmed a key metric — that it’s on track to free cash flow break even this year and doesn’t need outside financing anymore to fund day-to-day business. That was a milestone affirmed in the company’s January report, and only reaffirmed the bull thesis as the entire entertainment business continues its shift to streaming.

Canadian National came out with the [details of the offer today](https://www.cn.ca/en/news/2021/04/cn-makes-superior-proposal-to-combine-with-kansas-city-southern/), which include $200 cash and 1.059 $CNI shares for each $KSU share, valuing $KSU at just about $325 as of market open. (This compares to CP's previous offer of $90 and .489 CP shares or about $275 for each $KSU share at time of offer.)

This new bid sets up a big potential struggle for the last major railroad outside the big 6. KCS would have to pay a $700M breakup fee to CP in order to accept another deal, but the offer from CN is significantly better. Both deals would still be subject to STB approval, which is uncertain, and CN may have an even harder time getting approval given some overlap with the existing KCS network.

Canadian Pacific has already [fired back in a statement](https://www.railwayage.com/freight/cn-counters-cpkc-with-a-superior-proposal/?RAchannel=regulatory):

&gt; “CN’s proposal is massively complex and likely to fail,” CP said, guns blazing in a press release issued late on April 20. “[It] would create the third-largest Class I railroad [after UP and BNSF] and destabilize the competitive balance in the North American rail industry. The only combination involving KCS that is clearly in the public interest is the one that Canadian Pacific has proposed, which has already garnered support from more than 400 shippers and other stakeholders. While remaining the smallest of the six U.S. Class I railroads by revenue, a combination [of] CP and KCS creates stronger single-line competition against existing Class I routes.

KCS shareholders are likely feeling like the belle of the ball with multiple bidders now in the mix and the lurking potential of a bid from Union Pacific or even Berkshire Hathaway (BNSF). At minimum CP would likely have to improve their offer in order to see it accepted. $KSU was up 15% to $295.50 at the end of today's trading."|investing|The belle of the ball?

1618945936.0|0.0|t3_muxxha|45.0|"To understand what’s going on with Credit Suisse right now, we have to first discuss two major events that happened in the financial world since the last quarterly report: The collapse of Greensill and Archegos.

Greensill Capital was a supply chain financial services company that made money in three ways:

* Reverse factoring^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_finance)
* Factoring^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_\(finance\))
* Future accounts receivables finance^[3](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivablefinancing.asp)

Future accounts receivables finance tends to be especially risky since the lender is essentially issuing a loan to the lendee against collateral that the lendee has been promised from another party but has not yet received. However, Greensill may have actually taken this one step further and issued loans with collateral being money the lendee was predicted to be promised but had not yet actually been promised.

In July of 2020, one of Greensill’s insurers, Tokio Marine, discovered that a Tokio Marine employee had broken internal risk management limits in some way while insuring Greensill Capital (I’m guessing it’s directly related to the aggressive future accounts receivables financing practices, but I don’t have any evidence or sources to back this up). In response, Tokio Marine ceased insuring Greensill, leaving $4.8 billion of working capital uninsured. Greensill attempted to get an extension of coverage but failed and was forced to look for a new insurer. The problem was that no one wanted to insure them. On March 1st, 2021, after eight months of having billions of uninsured working capital and even more default insurance that expired over that previous weekend, Credit Suisse began freezing supply-chain investment funds in Greensill. That very same day, Greensill began filing for insolvency, and insolvency protection was granted on the 8th of March. I’ll skip the boring stuff, but Credit Suisse’s loss is estimated to be roughly $3 billion. I don’t know exactly how much of that is going to hit CS directly vs. their clients, but needless to say, it won’t be pretty either way.

Now let’s talk about Archegos.

Archegos was a family office that imploded in March of 2021. In order to understand what happened, you need to first understand what a Total Return Swap is.^[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_return_swap) Essentially (and this is simplified), a TRS allows you to ask the bank to hold a stock for you and pay you any appreciation or dividends, and you pay them a fixed (or sometimes variable) rate in return. This allows you to benefit from a share of a stock as if you held it yourself, but without having to actually own it. Because you don’t own the stock yourself with a TRS, Archegos was able to get a metric fuckton of loans without reporting their ViacomCBS (VIAC) and Discovery (DISCA) positions, thereby deceiving the loaners as to just how exposed and heavily leveraged they were on highly volatile positions.^[5](https://youtu.be/58Sx26Gt6H8) They did this for several major banks, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Nomura Holdings. Archegos was margin-called due to a large, synchronized ~27% drop in both VIAC and DISCA. Several large banks began liquidating Archegos’s TRS positions at roughly the same time in response (remember, the banks held these stocks, not Archegos themselves). This resulted in an additional 27% drop. Certain banks were able to get out faster than others, but CS and Nomura were especially slow to act.

So, what was the result of all of this? All-in-all, Archegos is expected to cost Credit Suisse somewhere in the ballpark of $4.7 billion.^[6](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/trading-update-202104.html) That figure is not expected to increase meaningfully as new information comes out.^[7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-question-credit-suisse-over-recent-archegos-related-stock-sales-11618934842) This $4.7 billion is in addition to the $3 billion loss from Greensill, bringing the final loss for Credit Suisse to somewhere in the ballpark of $7.7 billion in a single quarter. This is 95% of CS's total operating income (profit) for the past three years.

So, with all of these big, scary numbers, why am I still bullish?

Simply put, their balance sheet doesn’t justify the hit Credit Suisse’s stock took. CS had $805.8 billion in assets, $139.1 billion (17.3%) of that in cash alone as of December 31st, 2020.^[8](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/balance-sheet?p=CS) A $7.7 billion loss is only 0.95% of assets and 5.5% of cash – they could eat this loss almost 18 times and wouldn’t have to liquidate a single non-cash asset. The loss as compared to equity ($65.3 billion) is significantly bigger, constituting an 11.7% hit after subtracting liabilities. However, this, in my opinion, does not justify the ~30% hit the stock has taken.^[9](https://i.imgur.com/QZmciLp.png) To build on this, their price to book ratio was 0.56 as of five days ago^[10](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/key-statistics?p=CS), which also indicates CS is a strong value investment, Book value is sitting at $17.74 but the current price is only $10.30, meaning there is at least 72% upside, although that is probably unrealistic in the short and medium terms.

As if this wasn’t enough, Credit Suisse has been in business since 1856, and it will take a lot more than a $7.7 billion loss to bring a financial giant like this to its knees. In fact, they are even named as one of the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI),^[11](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_131111.pdf) They are, quite literally (and by definition), too big to fail. The responsible executives have also been removed^[12](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/changes-in-the-exb-credit-suisse-ch-202104.html) which shows they are going to be taking their risk management far more seriously in the future. Loss prevention on this scale will probably not happen again for some time because this loss is going to be at the forefront of their minds for a while.

How can this play go wrong then? Well, in the long-term, I’m confident I’m right and that the market is overreacting to Greensill and Archegos. It did wipe about three years of profit from the balance sheet, but financially, the company is in a pretty solid place regardless. There are too many positive forces holding CS up to allow it to act as a catalyst for more bad news, and the current price reflects an overly bearish scenario. People are comparing Archegos to Longterm Capital Management when that is simply not the case. LTCM ended up leveraging themselves to the tune of $1.25 trillion while Archegos lost somewhere in the ballpark of $10-$20 billion with VIAC and DISCA. That said, CS certainly has the opportunity to go south in the short term. CS reports Q1 results on April 22nd, two days from now^[13](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/events/calendar.html) and, especially considering the market’s behavior over the past several days, I think it’s possible that investors will panic after listening to the earnings call. They may overestimate the damage, sell in fear, and cause the stock to drop even further. The reality is that this bank is not going anywhere. CS is going to be around in 5-10 years no matter what, yet the current pricing feels like investors expect doomsday on April 22nd. The second scenario is that the earnings call inspires confidence, although I personally this is less likely due to the fact that this did wipe out three years of profit. In this scenario, the best-case scenario I can realistically see happening is CS trading sideways, since some people are going to sell anyway. If it does dip, I’m hoping to pick up as many of those shares as possible.

I want to be clear that I still very much have questions about how the fine details are going to work when it comes to the loss’s interaction with Credit Suisse’s balance sheet. I am not quite sure what amount of the damage is going to hit CS’s clients vs. falling directly on Credit Suisse. The answer to that question is very relevant, yet I have not been able to find a clear answer. I also do not know for sure what the post-earnings reaction will be. My guess is just that: a guess. Also, if I’m missing or misanalyzing this, please do call me out as I genuinely want this to be the highest quality DD possible. Thanks for reading to the end!

Edit: I'm aware GS and MS destroyed CS here - hell, I spent the past week reading about it. I believe in the American banks for more, I just think CS stock is pricing in a hellfire scenario.

Edit 2: The Q1 report has gone live and can be found [here](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/quarterly-interim-reports/quarterly-results.html). I won't tell you what to think, but I do want to give my personal thoughts. I wasn't too surprised with most of the presentation, although I would definitely have liked to see less use of ""adjusted"" and ""excluding significant items"" in the financial reports. I do stand by my long-term thesis that CS's present valuation is excessively bearish, as well as my short-term thesis that the stock will likely not do too well in the coming months. I also want to clarify that this post was not trying to convince people that these two events weren't big deals - I did a ton of research on it for a week straight, I know it's a big deal. I think people were interpreting my post as optimistic for the short term when that is absolutely not the case. **I do not believe CS is going to do well in the short term.** When I say long-term, I mean long-term. This is a play that I believe will likely take several years to pay off."|investing|I think Credit Suisse (CS) Investors Are Overreacting to Greensill and Archegos|45.0|0.78

Venmo, which is owned by PayPal (PYPL), said its more than 70 million customers can buy bitcoin [and other coins] for as little as $1.

Cryptocurrency can often feel confusing and inaccessible to newbies, so Venmo will offer in-app guides and videos to help answer commonly asked questions and share information about the world of crypto.

The payment company hopes that this new initiative ""demystifies some of the common questions and misconceptions that consumers may have,"" Darrell Esch, senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, said in a statement.

More than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing cryptocurrency or equities, according to the payments company. And 20% of those customers started doing so during the pandemic.

Last week, crypto enthusiasm soared as trading platform Coinbase went public at a valuation of $86 billion... Cryptocurrency backers have spent years insisting that bitcoin and other digital coins could revolutionize the world of finance. That hasn't happened yet, but Venmo's announcement is another example of how crypto is creeping ever closer toward mainstream acceptance.

Venmo is joining a list of other companies that recently began recognizing or accepting cryptocurrencies. Tesla has started accepting bitcoin payments for its cars and now holds some of the digital currency on its balance sheet. Payment processors including Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are trying to streamline crypto payments on their networks. Goldman Sachs will reportedly soon offer its private wealth management clients avenues to invest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. And Morgan Stanley announced that it will offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds.

Maybe someone will find it usefull and i will find some new information here.  Also English its not my native language, sorry in advance for some mistakes. 

  
SPAR Group is a leading global merchandising and marketing services company, providing a broad range of services to retailers, manufacturers and distributors around the world.  Our specialists are in stores restocking shelves, auditing inventory, performing competitive price shopping, setting up exciting promotions, assembling fixtures and furniture, preparing new locations for grand openings, assisting with sales and more. Its from their 10K.  


I screen stocks for their fundamentals and then, if i see something interesting there, iam going deeper.

**Lets see their multiples first:**

\- P/E 10,4x

\- P/B 1,1x

\- ROIC 26%

\- Net debt (- 2,7 mln $) ( they have more cash in their balance than debt).

\- Total debt/ CFO( cash flow from operations) = 1,5x. 

They have really good fundamentals and strong balance sheet. Also positive FCFF ( free cash flow to the firm).  

Their revenue  for 2020 was 230,5 mln $( 252,8 mln $ in 2019, - 9% YOY Growth). It consist of two majore sources. Revenue in United states was 92,1 mln $, International revenue 138,4 mln $.

  


| Net international revenue: | **2020** | YOY Growth |2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Brazil| **49,940**|\-24%| 65,942|
|South Africa | **28,235** |4%| 27,201 |
|Mexico | **22,679**|\-3%| 23,324|
|China | **12,401** |\-5%| 12,993 |
|Japan | **9,273**|\-19%| 11,469 |
|India | **8,589**  |\-3%| 8,813   |
|Canada | **6,294** |\-31%| 9,059  |
|Australia | **988**  |\-68%| 3,087|
|Turkey|**-**|\-100%| 268  |
|Total international revenue|**138,399 (59,9% of revenue)**|\-15%| 162,156  (64,1% of revenue)|

As you can see, Covid has  a big negative impact  on their International business.

&amp;#x200B;

 After watching their fundamentals and revenue, i though, that maybe this is a value play, because  their revenue  deterioration may associated with COVID only. 

I created DCF  model to be sure. Even in a bad scenario with CAGR(Compound Annual Growth Rate)  for their FCFF (-3,85%) for the upcoming 5 years and  WACC 9% ) their intrinsic  value  is about **3 $ per share, with current price 1,66 $ per share.**

Seems like no brainer, but i think that this is a value trap right here and i will try to explain my thoughts. Always ask yourself **Why is this stock being sold at this price?** 

I didnt see any drivers for this stock and why their price should goes up. Their main business heavily  depends on international retailers, E-commerce share of a retail market will only grow( especially in Brazil and China, that have 35% and 8,9% of their international revenue accordingly), and revenue of SPAR Group will only shrink over time because of that, slowly but surely.  I don’t think that a lot of people will find desire to buy this stock. 

Yes, its a good company with really strong fundamentals right now and with intrinsic value about 3$ per share, but i will not buy it. Maybe i missing something,  will be grateful if you show me what."|investing|SPAR Group (SGRP), Smal Cap stock, Full DD|32.0|0.83

**Overview of Q1 2021 Results**

* I’ve spread Coinbase’s key financial results and metrics over the past 9 quarters [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzNvBZZVoAgWzDW?format=png&amp;name=large) and all you really need to do is look at the last column to see the insane growth Coinbase has experienced in the past quarter
* To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:
   * **$1.8BN in revenue** \- 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue **combined**
   * **$1.1BN in EBITDA** (63% EBITDA margin) and **$765M in net income** (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business
   * $223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = **11% market share (share has been growing from 5% in 2019**
   * **56 million verified users -** 148% increase vs. Q4 2020
   * **6.1 million monthly transacting users** \- 118% increase vs. Q4 2020
* In short, Coinbase couldn’t have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders

[**S-1 Income statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&amp;table=35)

* Already went through revenue, EBITDA, and net income above so won’t go into those numbers in this section and instead here are some interesting details about how Coinbase operates:
   * Only 5% of total revenue comes from **institutional trading** vs. 90% from **retail** ([source](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg))
      * As you can see from this [chart](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg), institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren’t as big of a revenue driver for the company
   * As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase’s [subscription and services revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg) which is **growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue**
      * These revenue streams are important because they aren’t as reliant on the volatile crypto market
   * Another key component of revenue you’ll want to keep track of is **Coinbase’s fees** which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a [slight downward trend](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg) which may continue over time as competition intensifies
   * Something I personally find most impressive is that only **4% of revenue was spent on sales &amp; marketing**. The company states that [90% of its retail users came through word of mouth](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&amp;hl=450165:450601&amp;hl_id=vkh5d_8u5) which just means customers are freely marketing for the company
* So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly [if you look at the quarterly figures](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg)
   * The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics
* This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at [this visual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg). The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place
* **Main takeaway:** Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase

[**S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&amp;table=38)

* Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with **a little less than $3BN in free cash flow** which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):
   * Custodial funds are basically **cash deposits customers are holding** on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is **restricted** form using this cash
   * This means that custodial funds actually **inflate** Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers
   * As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to **$300 million** and their free cash flow is closer to **$285 million** which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above
* Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures
* Definitions in case it’s helpful: 
   * **Cash from operations** represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.
   * **Free cash flow** is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends

[**S-1 Balance Sheet Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&amp;table=34)

* With **$1BN in cash and no debt,** Coinbase is in a very solid position
   * Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section
* Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the **crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings** which are interrelated and offset one another
* The last thing I want to mention is that **Coinbase’s PP&amp;E is only $50 million** which is tiny compared to the company’s scale
   * Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&amp;E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage

**Coinbase Valuation**

* The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations
* With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = **$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,** which represents **464% year over year growth** vs. 2020
* Comparing against some of the [fastest growing software companies in the world](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png), no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year
* As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside
   * 9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$250 / share**
   * 11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$313 / share**
* **Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase** with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction

**What I’m Doing**

* I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at **$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (\~5% max)** as I think that it's a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been
   * I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in
* That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just **pure personal speculation**), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises

**TLDR:** In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company's volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn't blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I'm bullish on crypto in the long-run, I'm cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well."|investing|Coinbase Deep Dive Diligence - Part 2 of 2 (Quantitative Thoughts)|179.0|0.91

US investment giant Vanguard aims to shake up the financial advice market with the launch of a cut-price service tomorrow.

Already known for low fees for its funds, which track markets rather than using skilled managers to pick investments, Vanguard will charge 0.79 per cent a year for financial advice – including the cost of the investment funds and platform fee.

The move could send shockwaves through an industry where the fees of fund managers and financial advisers often add up to more than double this.

Traditional financial advisers charge an initial fee of 2.4 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent a year in fund and advice costs on average, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.

Vanguard, the world's second largest asset manager, could also grab billions of pounds in business from the estimated nine out of ten people who do not currently get any financial advice – often because they fear they can't afford it.

Sean Hagerty, head of Vanguard Europe, says: 'For many investors the cost of advice is a barrier – it is not uncommon to see total fund management and advice costs of more than 2 per cent.'

Vanguard's service will not be as comprehensive as offered by independent financial advisers.

For example, its advice does not cover inheritance tax planning, property and other assets and insurance products.

It also does not enable savers to buy funds aside from its own.

For savers with complex finances, specific goals, or who want plenty of support, an independent financial adviser could still be the best solution. But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.

This is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.

In 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year – considerably cheaper than the incumbents.

And last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year – capped at £375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.

Vanguard hopes its new 'personal financial planning' service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.

It will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of £1,073,100.

Any money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.

Hagerty says: 'We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people – and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.'

Initially the service will only be open to people with at least £50,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard's range of funds.

Those with savings of £50,000 to £100,000 will be offered a 'digital financial planning experience'.

They will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.

Savers with more than £100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.

Meanwhile those with more than £750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.

Hagerty says: 'Financial advice will be offered by real people – not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.'


Vanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. 

These alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.

Advice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.

Vanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.

Hagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.

Yet these advisers might still have plenty to fear – with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a £250,000 lump sum could save more than £190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.

Hagerty adds: 'With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.'

Most independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about £150 an hour.

New player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of £500 a year.

Jeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.

Nutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off £575 for 'personalised planning and advice'.

Hargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for 'investment advice' on the first £1 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of £495 if you receive advice by phone.

Ongoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.

Fidelity offers a 'Wealth Management' investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges."|investing|Vanguard to launch UK Personal Financial Planning|463.0|0.95

1618706696.0|0.0|t3_mt2tfk|1061.0|"I wanted to write a series of posts regarding different investment styles, the portfolio allocations suggested by the styles, and the assumptions and hidden factors underlying each style. For my first post I will start with the most boomer, r/investing, bogleheads investing style originating from followers of Jack Bogle the founder of Vanguard.

Jack Bogle, our savior, taught us all a sure-fire way to compounding wealth, retirement, and financial freedom: buy Vanguard stock and bond ETFs and then tell everyone you know about the dangers of paying 75bps to ARK funds because of compound interest.

Who am I to question historical 6-7% inflation adjusted returns in the S&amp;P500? As countless threads on r/personalfinance, r/investing, and any of the financial independence subreddits have explained, if you just buy VTSAX in your 401K and IRA you will be rich eventually because Einstein says the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.

The first bit of these threads that piss me off are the advocates for full portfolio allocation to US stocks. When you go “Fuck it, 100% stocks” you lose the only free lunch available which is diversification. Jack Bogle knew this and also recommended an allocation to bonds. The idea is that bonds and stocks are not correlated and so by combining the two assets you can achieve a return without as much variance. But when US stocks have been bull running for over a decade it’s hard to accept some historically lower variance return, so there’s a recency bias for advocating higher percentage allocations to stocks.

The reason that two uncorrelated assets one with higher mean returns (stocks) and one with lower mean returns (bonds) make sense to hold in a portfolio is because you don’t just care about mean return of the portfolio you also want low variance because higher variance means larger drawdowns which reduce compounding growth. Thus we are striving to be both mean and variance optimizers with our portfolios. I will dive deeper into mean-variance optimization and Markowitz portfolio theory when I cover Ray Dalio and risk-parity investing, but for now just remember more variance bad.

So if we realize there’s a recency bias among the gurus of r/investing and allocate to both VTSAX and VBTLX are we good? The answer is maybe, if we are in a falling rate environment and the uncorrelation of stocks and bonds holds then that is very likely a good steady compounding portfolio. If you allocate in this way you are making a bet on the correlations of stocks and bonds, and a bet on the macro environment. Recently stocks and bonds have had correlated moves and this is not a clear bet just because it has generally held to be true over the past several decades.

If you don’t want to take a view on the correlations of stocks and bonds going forward then you need a more complex portfolio that works in a variety of macro environments. In the next installment I will cover Ray Dalio’s All-Weather portfolio as an overview of risk-parity strategies which will attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the Bogle strategy but will still have its own shortcomings.

Hopefully this wasn’t too boring a post, I plan to cover more active investment styles like George Soros in future installments but wanted to start with the passive popular styles since I see it the most often."|investing|Investing Styles Part 1: Jack Bogle and Common Sense Investing|1061.0|0.94

Assuming prices of ETFs are the same, holding 0.71x VWO for every VT would give weights that match GDP distribution closely.

Adjusting for prices, which are not same (VT = $101.83 and VWO = $52.78), gives 1.37x VWO for every VT.

EDIT: I stand corrected. Many have pointed out that the stock market is not the economy. VT holdings are based on market capitalization. China apparently has a high GDP, but not so many publicly companies traded companies with a high market cap (see  comment of [irresponsible\_owl](https://www.reddit.com/user/irresponsible_owl/)). Comparing [market cap of companies by country](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD/rankings) with the market allocation of VT shows a smaller descrepancy than with GDP, but still it seems like US is overweighted (57% instead of 42%)."|investing|VT is not as global as I thought.

The last time I posted about weed stocks, I explained how US cannabis stocks (ie Trulieve/Cresco/Greenthumb/Curaleaf) are all awaiting big legislative changes throughout the year.

I'm posting now, because the first big piece of legislation, the SAFE act, is finally being introduced to Congress next week.

&gt;The message, which was sent to stakeholders on Friday by a staffer for Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the bill’s sponsor, says that while the office is still awaiting scheduling confirmation, they “think the bill will be on the House floor for a vote early next week,” and that will be confirmed when the full calendar is released by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) “later today.”

SAFE act is a game-changer US MSOs that currently bleed absurd amounts of money and resources because of harsh federal banking restrictions.

&gt;The legislation would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties. Fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working with the industry, forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets of crime and creates complications for financial regulators.

As this news has been confirmed by a fresh leak (that was only published within the hour I'm making this post) there is an opportunity to buy the *""rumour""* in sense as the market has yet to react today.

I want to share some info on $ASTS (AST Spacemobile) to save potential retail investors time when they do their DD. There is this idea of ""20-100x Return Or 100% Loss"" associated with $ASTS floating around, but AST Spacemobile is no $NKLA. The technology was proven to work by AST and again by Lynk. Apple is diving in this as well. AST Spacemobile the real deal with over 1000 patents, extensive satellite expertise particularly their CEO, and their own majority owned satellite subsidiarity Nanoavionics and is already cash flow positive. AST Spacemobile itself has no debt.

The good stuff: the data that got these giant institutional investors Vadafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Samsung NEXT, AT&amp;T, Cisneros all lined up to give money to AST Spacemobile started with the tiny 12kg Bluewalker 1 satellite that successfully proved that AST tech worked:

""*On April 1, 2019, AST successfully launched  BW1, which connected directly to an antenna (“BW2”) at AST’s facility in Midland, Texas, to test its satellite to ground communications  technology. During such testing, AST was able to validate its cellular  architecture and was capable of managing communications delays from LEO  orbit and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-LTE protocol.*""

The 1.5 ton, 10-meter antenna Bluewalker 3 satellite currently in progress of being built and is slated to launch at the end of 2021 is much more capable and will fully enable AST to demonstrate their tech:

""*The BW3 test satellite is expected to enable live ground, sea, and  airborne testing with unmodified LTE and 5G devices such as smartphones, tablets and internet of things (“IoT”) equipment. The satellite is also  expected to enable live testing for voice, video and data. Testing will  be available for approximately six minutes per satellite pass  approximately two times per day in certain areas. For U.S. based  testing, AST will utilize a gateway installed in Midland, Texas and in  Hawaii. AST will install at least two additional gateways for the full constellation, one on the east coast and a second on the west coast. With the BW3 test satellite, AST’s main objective is to demonstrate the entire technology stack of the AST constellation satellite design by  providing direct broadband communications between an AST- patented LEO  satellite and standard compliant LTE and 5G devices without any  modification using UE standard in select bands in the 698 MHz to 960 MHz range and using gateways located in a number of selected countries, including the U.S. The BW3 test satellite will provide the testing and validation plans for the BB1 satellite design, expected to be used for  the first phase of commercial satellites comprising the SpaceMobile  Service.*""

Lynk, a competing company, also [demonstrated](https://vimeo.com/398041128/e10228da19) the technology worked when they successfully connected a tiny satellite to a normal handset and witnessed by independent third-party observers:

Additionally, **Apple** is [reportedly](https://www.channelnews.com.au/telstra-set-to-become-surplus-to-requirement-if-apple-satellite-iphones-take-off/) not holding back on putting a lot of resources to dive into this potentially massively lucrative market:

""*Currently Apple is spending billions, developing a new satellite service  that will beam internet services directly to devices, bypassing carrier  networks*"" 

Apple has [already started the process](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1160408/apple-fi-5g-killer-technology-profits-confidential-by-ray-blanco--anti5g-stock-research-report) of doing the very thing that AST Spacemobile is set up to do, calling it Apple-Fi:

""***To roll out its revolutionary technology, Apple has reportedly hired  Michael Trela and John Fenwick, two world-famous aerospace engineers who  are widely considered to be pioneers in the field of satellite  technology. Not only that, Apple also recently brought onboard Matt Ettus, Ashley Moore Williams, and Daniel Ellis, experts renowned for  their work with wireless technologies. Not only that, but it is also  being alleged that Apple is currently in the process of creating a  satellite mesh network to provide its customers with insane network  coverage. In this regard, the company has already filed plans with the  FCC to launch between 1,400 and 3,000 satellites.***""

In order to connect from Earth to space LEO and back, you either need a big dish/antenna on Earth to connect to a small satellite or increase the size of the satellite to connect to a small, normal cellphone. A fairly long technical paper submitted to the FCC [here](https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PDR-20200413-00034/2511994) describes how AST Spacemobile will use its constellation of satellites to act as a 900 meters squared satellite. This is proven tech and has been done many times.

The document found [here](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10061972201614/AST%205G%20Fund%20Ex%20Parte%2010-06-20%20(00168439xC33F1).pdf) submitted to the FCC describing how they brilliantly deal with doppler issue:

Some interesting technical points were described in the document:

""*-The AST low earth orbiting (“LEO”) satellites system (“SpaceMobile”)  is able to communicate directly with standard unmodified off-the shelf  cellular devices from their 700 kilometer high orbits through the use of  AST’s patented architecture of large LEO satellites with  specially-designed proprietary antenna arrays with very large aperture.  The configuration results in enough antenna gain to enable the satellite  to communicate effectively with standard mobile handsets operating on  terrestrial broadband wireless frequencies.*

*- The  AST SpaceMobile system will connect to user terminals that operate on  standard 3GPP  frequencies that are licensed to terrestrial carriers  with which AST has agreements that grant AST consent to use the  spectrum.  The service will fill the terrestrial carriers’ gaps in  coverage to provide broadband mobile services where the terrestrial  carrier spectrum is not available or in use. This mitigates and  eliminates the risk of interference.*

*-  Potential interference also will be managed by the use of other  methods, including frequency selection, Inter-Cell Interference  Coordination (ICIC), beams control, and power control. These techniques  are discussed at length in the Technical Sharing Analysis submitted to  the Commission by AST on July 6, 2020;amendment to IBFS File No.  SAT-PDR-20200413-00034 (Call Sign S3065).*

*- Each  satellite is capable of supporting approximately 2800 spot beams. The  satellite can generate cellular cells ranging from 12.5 kilometers  (C-band and CBRS) to 24-48kilometers (Lowband and midband). The  above-referenced Technical Sharing Analysis contains an overview of the  SpaceMobile approaches for frequency sharing and interference management  using parameters in this range.*

*- The SpaceMobile  service will meet a low(sub-100 ms) latency(with latency well below 40  ms). AST holds,and/or has pending, approximately 650 patent claims,many  of which pertain to advanced technology that will be implemented on the  ground to address Doppler and delay.*

*- The SpaceMobile service will meet and exceed the download and upload speed requirements of 35 Mbps / 3 Mbps.*

*-  AST’s patented technology incorporates beam handover,which is analogous  to the terrestrial user equipment (UE) handoff between neighboring base stations (eNodeB’s).  Based on the schedule files that list the handoff  time instances, the setting satellite simultaneously turns off,and the  rising satellite turns on a beam in the overlapping cell.AST’s patented  technologies for compensation of delay/Doppler makes the UEs in the cell  being handed off see near equal delay/Doppler before and after the handoff, making them synchronize quickly to new beams from rising formation. The UE keeps track of the received signal strength (RSSI) of  both the serving and adjacent beams. When the serving beam’s RSSI is  weaker than the adjacent beam’s RSSI, it requests serving eNodeB to initiate handoff. The decision to hand off or not is made by the serving eNodeB.*""

Here, AST claimed that their proprietary  antenna arrays with very large aperture allow them to have enough gain to communicate with mobile handsets. They also claim to have download/upload speed of at least 35 Mbps/3 Mbps and a latency well below 40ms. These numbers are highly conservative just to show that AST at minimum should qualify for a huge 5G grant. Starlink is on the same LEO as AST will be and Starlink is able to do latency in the 20's ms, which is inline with current terrestrial broadband/5G.

""*AST is building a new, unproven type of satellite constellation that’s a  riff on so-called “fractionated satellites,” which divide the  capability of one large satellite among several smaller ones. For  example, one satellite might host a scientific payload, while another  might be responsible for communicating with ground stations. The two  would communicate with one another through wireless links. A  fractionated satellite system has never flown in orbit, although Darpa  spent six years and more than $200 million dollars developing a  fractionated satellite before abandoning the concept in 2013 due to  budgetary constraints.*

*AST’s system will consist  of dozens of small, pizza box-sized satellites flying in formation as  they receive cell signals. According to AST’s founder and CEO Abel  Avellan, the system isn’t truly fractionated because each of the small  satellites will have the same capabilities, rather than splitting the  functionality of one larger satellite. But the formation will be managed  by a large control satellite, which will direct network traffic and  satellite movement like a conductor leading an orchestra. Although the  later versions of the satellites in AST’s system will communicate with  one another over Wi-Fi or a similar wireless protocol, Avellan says the  first satellites to go up will be physically connected.*

*The  advantage of AST’s approach is that the satellites can be spread out  over hundreds of feet. Since each satellite is itself a receiver and is  working in tandem with the others, this has the effect of creating a  massive antenna. “In essence we are building a very, very large  satellite with a lot of power that can connect directly to a handset,”  says Avellan. “Our system is a replica of the terrestrial network in  space.”*""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The CEO himself is an engineer and communication/satellite genius. He's not a salesman and definitely isn't the type that can get all of those giant institutions to invest in $ASTS through words instead of concrete data. There are more patents and technical stuff dealing with waveform and others but I found them to be uninteresting to traders and not worth listing them all.

To conclude, anyone that claims this stock goes to zero is ignorant to the technical data at hand and completely dismisses the incredible work AST Spacemobile research team has done. I have a strong belief that any analyst from the [numerous banks](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1373825830938378241) Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Raymond James, Scotia, LightShed and Benchmark that attended AST Spacemobile analyst day will have favorable price target and analysis."|investing|AST Spacemobile ($ASTS), Lynk, and Apple all will be competing for the lucrative $40B mobile to satellite market|218.0|0.95

Li-Cycle is the leading recycler of Lithium Ion batteries in North America. They plan to use a SPAC merger with Peridot Acquisition Corp. The merger will allow Li-Cycle to construct new plants to increase their production capacity by roughly 34,000% by the year 2025.

&amp;#x200B;

* Lithium EV batteries are a real and threat to the environment. Not only is the mining detrimental but so is the disposal of them in landfills where they leak hazardous chemicals. This makes recycling the material an necessity for a sustainable future. A famous CEO recently said that he sees a world where lithium mining will cease and that all new lithium batteries can be made with recycled lithium. Currently 98% of lead-acid batteries get recycled but only 2% of lithium is recycled. That is where with Li-Cycle comes in.  
* Although Li-Cycle has a very aggressive growth plan, their future intake and offtake are already contracted through 2030. All of their growth projections show what growth could look like up to 2025, however their contracts continue into 2030. 
* Something that could interrupt their growth are new players in the field. Although they have patented their technology, Tesla is working on their own lithium recycling solution, and upgrading the battery technology to give batteries a lower environmental impact. Although Tesla plans to try to cut out lithium recyclers when recycling their batteries, they currently recycle through third parties. The firm Tesla currently uses to recycle their batteries is called Redwood Materials. The process they use is reportedly very harsh on the environment as it requires burning the lithium releasing toxic gasses into the atmosphere.
* A promising catalyst for fast growth is the current Biden administration. They are looking at passing a $2T infrastructure plan which would likely include provisions for providing contracts and subsidies to make it even more profitable.
* I believe that Li-Cycles growth is significantly de-risked and makes the post merger valuation fairly inexpensive. I recommend it as a buy with a price target of $20.

The Paulsboro, New Jersey-based Your Hometown Deli is the sole location for Hometown International, which has an eye-popping market value despite totaling $35,748 in sales in the last two years combined, according to securities filings.

“Someone pointed us to Hometown International (HWIN), which owns a single deli in rural New Jersey ... HWIN reached a market cap of $113 million on February 8. The largest shareholder is also the CEO/CFO/Treasurer and a Director, who also happens to be the wrestling coach of the high school next door to the deli. The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn said in a letter to clients published Thursday.

Hometown, which appears to have begun trading in 2019, according to FactSet, has shares that trade over the counter and rarely has more than a few hundred shares change hands per day. Often, there are no trades logged in an entire trading day.

Still, the company’s market cap is just over $100 million, according to FactSet.

Hometown did not immediately return a request seeking comment made to the phone number listed in the company’s securities filings. A manager was not available to comment at the deli’s phone number.

According to the company’s latest 10-K filing, the company’s single location was closed from March 23 to September 8 of last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, the company’s stock price rose to $9.25 per share from $3.25 per share. It last traded at just under $14 per share.

The company sold 2.5 million shares last year and has about 60 total shareholders, according a filing.

Hometown reported more than $600,000 in expenses last year, up from about $154,000 in 2019. The company also reported a net cash gain of $2.2 million from financing activities, such as selling stock, in 2020.

Einhorn’s highlighting of Hometown comes as politicians, regulators and high-profile investors have publicly fretted about the boom in certain types of stocks over the past year.

As a new wave of retail investors joined the market in recent months, special purpose acquisition companies have launched at a record pace and some stocks, like Game Stop and Discovery, have seen wild swings after being bid up by traders on Reddit or hedge funds.

The over-the-counter stock market, often referred to as pink sheets and penny stocks, have historically been a risky place for investors. Shares of penny stocks have also soared in recent months.

Source: [https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view\_id=49&amp;clip\_id=15395](https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=49&amp;clip_id=15395)

Facts:

500 Million Cubic Feet of Natty Gas a day for five days at $55 on average spot during the storm.

500MMcF = 500,000 BTU.

500,000 BTU \*55 \* 5 = $137,500,000 in revenue in five days.

The 500MCF amount checks out as that's about a third of their daily production which is what would be available to take advantage of the spot prices as about 60-66% of their production is contracted out at a given time.

Giving their working interest is about 82%... the well royalties would be about 18% so they should get 82% of 137.5M or 112.75M. Now the cost of getting the gas to Texas during the storm were higher but I am willing to say they were not more than 1M a day... so thinking they walked away with about 107.75M in 5 days. Given they would have normally sold at around $3 per BTU at the time the extra NI is likely at least 107.75M - (500,000 \*3\*5) = 100.25M.

Now the company has already started to leverage the storm windfall to refinance its debt at a cheaper interest rate and at a longer maturity and the extra cash inflow from this quarter will serve to strengthen their position. Their slide deck says savings of 45M in interest expense already. Bankers already started giving them cheaper debt immediately after the storm. So its likely the company will only continue to cut down its interest expense with this additional cash flow... which further supports the share price.

Fully Diluted Share Count \~215,000,000 so 45M in savings in annual interest they already have disclosed = further 21 cents per share in earnings (just from less interest on same amount of debt aka refinancing).

Street still has earnings at 12 cents per share for Q1 2021. They are asleep at the wheel and likely never sat through 9.5 hours of senate hearings on the 26th of February. Thinking the real numbers, all else equal, will be north of 50 cents for Q1 2021 alone. This is high for a company that is only trading at $5.00 a share. If it gets 50 cents Q1 and what the street lazily thinks of 15 cents on average for the next three quarters... 2021 is going to end up with 95 cents per share... on a $5 share price if we add the locked in interest savings that is 1.16 cents per share. This gives the company an estimated P/E of 4.3x... This is multibagger territory and the company already has most of its production hedged over 2.50 so the risk of shortfall in Q2/Q3/Q4 is mitigated if Nat Gas revisits the covid panic.

One thing both the Trump and Biden administrations have agreed on is  that the U.S. needs to expand domestic manufacturing, and soon.

The  pharmaceutical industry in particular has outsourced much of its  manufacturing to take advantage of lower costs and more lax  environmental laws in other countries.

1618516360.0|0.0|t3_mrmmk1|24.0|"Here is why I am initiating a short position in Capital Senior Living Corporation (Ticker Symbol: CSU) and why you should probably take a look into it too: 

Business:

Capital Senior Corporation, or CSU, provides senior living services to elderly population over the age of 75+. As of December of 2019, which is the date of their last annual report, they own 126 housing operations in 23 states with approximately 16,000 residents in total. The services they provide include senior living services, assisted living services, meals, healthcare, and other personal care services for the elderly. 

The company makes money by charging a monthly ""rent"" to the elderly who live in their residences. In their annual report, they mention that their residents are either in a financial position to pay for the service themselves or have family, such as children, who can provide them with the financial support to pay for this. In addition to owning multiple properties throughout the U.S, CSU also leases properties. 

Qualitative Analysis:

The qualitative reasons for the short position are quite obvious. 8 out of 10 COVID deaths reported are for people over the age of 65. This means that the target customer base for CSU has been hit the hardest. Unlike many other businesses, such as retail or hospitality, where you can argue that customers will come back once COVID subsides, you cannot make that same argument for this company. The death rate of this demographic suggests that many of CSU's customers are not going to be coming back, even post-COVID. 

The other consideration with COVID here is that people are much more likely to distrust retirement homes or senior living services moving forward. There was a massive scandal in New York City where Governor Cuomo pushed elderly people into retirement homes, only to end up killing a large portion of that population. I'm not gonna go into the political details of it, but you can read about it here: [https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/)

All of this suggests that elderly people are not incentivized to go into retirement homes anytime soon. Even with the large vaccination numbers under the Biden administration, it is unlikely that the entire effects of the pandemic are going to subside anytime soon. If you are elderly and especially at risk, you are much more likely to call in for home care or some other alternatives, rather than finding yourself in a living service with other people where the chances of the virus spreading are high. 

Now there are two ways you can argue against this short position on a qualitative basis. First, if you do some research, you'll find out that CSU recently vaccinated most of its residents. However, this doesn't solve the problem that they lost most of their customers in the past year, who are never coming back. Even with the vaccination, elderly people are not going to feel confident about living in these facilities for a long time. Second, you can argue that healthcare services in the United States are getting better. This means that life expectancies are going to be higher in the future, meaning more elderly people living = better business for CSU. However, given the effects of this pandemic, we are not going to see CSU occupancy and revenue numbers return back to pre-COVID levels for a very long time. Life expectancies are probably going to remain suppressed due to COVID for a long time, and I am taking this short position with a 1-1.5 year time horizon. By the time the life expectancy rolls back, I will have exited the short with a pretty hefty return. 

Financial Analysis:

Now the quantitative and financial analysis of this company makes it even more clear why a short position is obvious. In 2018, the company's revenue dropped by 1.1%. In 2019, revenues dropped by 2.8%. In 2020, revenues dropped by almost 20%

Now let's look at net income. Since 2015, the company has not turned a single year of profit. In fact, their net income has decreased every single year. From -$14.3 million in 2015 to -$295.4 million in 2020. Even without the COVID-19 impact, this company was on a downward slope towards bankruptcy. With COVID, it seems unlikely that this company can ever do a turnaround. 

Looking at the balance sheet only confirms this thesis. As of now, the company has cash of only 17.9 million while the short-term and long-term debt of over 900 million. Even if the company liquidated all of its properties that it owns, which has a book value of roughly 928 million, the company can barely remain solvent. Add on top of this the fact that the company has been selling portions of its property to REITs in order to keep operating, you quickly realize that CSU can never reach pre-COVID 19 levels of revenue ever again. 

Add on top of this that the company's stock is up from $13 to $40 a share over the past year, you realize that something doesn't add up here. The intrinsic value of the company is far far lower than where it is trading today, giving additional conviction to my short thesis. In my opinion, CSU is one of the zombie companies that's being kept alive due to PPP and reckless spending, but soon enough, people will realize that their business model no longer works, even in a post-COVID world.

1618502557.0|0.0|t3_mrhrgv|1825.0|"""In Amazon’s 1997 letter to shareholders, our first, I talked about our hope to create an “enduring franchise,” one that would reinvent what it means to serve customers by unlocking the internet’s power. I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.

We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn’t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren’t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.

Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They’re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they’re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:

I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on. I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.

### Create More Than You Consume

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.

Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.

We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.

So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.

Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.

Summarizing:  
Shareholders      $21B  
Employees          $91B  
3P Sellers            $25B  
Customers           $164B  
Total                    $301B

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.

Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.

Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.

If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.

Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

### Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work

The fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.

Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success. We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.

We dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.

One such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.

We’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout 2021.

Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.

We employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.

When we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.

Our increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

And we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.

If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.

### The Climate Pledge

In an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don’t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.

Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It won’t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st century.

Now, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don’t exist.

The Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.

Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian – and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We’ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 – saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.

To further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium – and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.

I have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We’ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I’m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.

### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

\* \* \*

As always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.

To all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.

Sincerely,

To our shareowners:

&gt; 
&gt; Gensler, chosen for the role by President Joe Biden, will now play a key part in enforcing and drafting the rules that govern Wall Street, investors and a wide range of other financial entities.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, with the SEC commissioners possessing a 3-2 Democratic majority, Gensler will likely have a long to-do list after he settles in to his new job.
&gt; 
&gt; Progressives expect the 63-year-old to follow through on his promises to look into a range of topics, including digital currencies, the Game Stop trading mania and how corporate America prioritizes environmental, social and governance issues.
&gt; 
&gt; Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive, is perhaps best known in Washington for his unyielding work at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where he devised the regulatory framework for the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market.
&gt; 
&gt; Democrats and Republicans alike asked Gensler in March whether he would scrutinize payment for order flow and game-like tactics used by brokerages to entice customers to their platforms. Both subjects received attention on Capitol Hill this year after January’s wild trading in Game Stop, AMC Entertainment and other stocks.
&gt; 
&gt; Gensler also noted potential problems with the current structure of payment for order flow, a common practice on Wall Street whereby trading firms, such as Citadel Securities, pay companies to send them their customers’ orders for execution.
&gt; 
&gt; Questioned in March how the SEC should regulate bitcoin and other digital assets, Gensler replied that the responsibility could fall across the government depending on how assets such as bitcoin are classified. One of his earliest and most-anticipated decisions as head of the SEC will be whether to allow the creation of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 10 billion of revenue vs Netflix's 23 B\*. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside.

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

**What is Coinbase?**

* Founded in 2012, Coinbase is mainly known as a company that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies regardless if you’re an everyday investor or a hedge fund
* The company serves 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions like hedge funds, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries
* **On the retail side,** Coinbase’s main products are its mobile app which has a super easy to use interface and then there’s Coinbase Pro which is more for advanced traders
* **On the business side,** Coinbase also offers a lot of really interesting services, including trading for institutions, listing assets on Coinbase which probably comes at a high cost, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, cryptocurrency custody which just means helping institutions store crypto assets securely, and a venture capital arm that invests in crypto startups
* **Main point:** Coinbase is much more than just a place to trade crypto and the company is creating an ecosystem where different parts of the business feed off each other to make the entire platform stronger

**The Coinbase Business Model**

* To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general
* I bring up the data below to show you that the crypto market is still in its early stages and is highly volatile
   * Since 2010, there were [4 major price cycles with peaks and troughs and each cycle lasted anywhere from 2-4 years](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d780a9f051a4bad78f1d0_Crypto%20Market%20Troughs.jpg)
   * Crypto was also uncorrelated to the equities market until Feb 2020 when COVID hit and [now there seems to be some correlation](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d781a08359644dfcf2a06_Crypto%20vs%20S%26P.jpg)
* Coinbase currently profits the most during periods of high volatility and high bitcoin prices and makes less during lower periods of volatility and low bitcoin prices
   * This is precisely why since 2018, Coinbase has been making a concerted effort to diversify its revenue streams in order to decrease its reliance on market volatility
* Since 2016, [7 of the 8 new products have been subscription and services](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d76da0e9756ba0684199b_Product.jpg) which really just shows you Coinbase’s focus on building a more stable business which as a potential Coinbase investor will be important to pay attention to over time 
* This strategy seems to already be producing results, with monthly transacting users appearing to be less correlated to crypto volatility but still related to bitcoin prices
   * For example, you can see that [volatility was at a 9 in both Q1 2020 and Q4 2020](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7d843678f71c68ee167_MTUs%20and%20Crypto%20Asset%20Volatility.jpg) but the number of users is much greater in Q4 which was also when bitcoin began rising dramatically 

**Market Statistics**

* Over the past 3 years, Coinbase has been able to more than **double its users from** [**23 million**](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7b0c5104fd10398b398_Verified%20Users.jpg) **to** [**56 million**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) which is really amazing growth 
* As a result, the company has been able to **grow its market share from 4.5% to** [**11.3%**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) over the past few years which is also quite impressive 
* **In terms of the total market,** since the end of 2012 to the end of 2020, the cryptocurrency market grew from $500 million to $782 billion which represents a 150% CAGR
   * Astonishingly, in just a few months, the **market cap has grown by about 181% to \~$2.2 trillion as of toda**y 
   * Simply put, of all the industries I’ve personally seen so far, there is none that is growing as quickly as the cryptocurrency market

**The Bull Case**

* First off is Coinbase’s branding
   * Especially for those in the states, Coinbase is **one of the top go-to crypto exchanges** for the average retail investor and many institutions
   * This in large part is due to the company’s **intense focus on following regulations** and the company dedicates 15% of its full time staff to legal, compliance, finance, and security functions
   * From the start, Coinbase also created one of the **easiest interfaces** for trading a very complex product and that has continued to be its edge ever since
   * Personally, I believe that this first mover advantage may erode over time as Coinbase charges the highest fees per trade, but I also believe the company benefits heavily from its branding due to its security and easy-to-use interface and may be able to charge a premium for a while, just as Apple does with its products which in many instances are less powerful machines than PCs
* Second is what is called the [company’s flywheel](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d7a786657bc8b497de52d_Network%20Effects.jpg)
   * Because customers **trust** Coinbase, the company is able to **attract** more and more customers 
   * This allows the company to **continue scaling** the company while also **adding more assets** onto the platform that customers can trade 
   * Coinbase can then **understand** their customer’s needs and **create** more innovative products that help keep customers on the platform 
   * This entire process **makes the overall platform stronger** which extends Coinbase’s leadership in the marketplace and allows the company to grow its market share 
   * To give you one concrete statistic of this flywheel taking effect, **Coinbase stated that 21% of users used a non-investing product in 2020 leading to an average net revenue increase per user of 90%**
* A third reason to be bullish on Coinbase is the **rapid growth of the crypto market** due to strong use cases and institutional trading
   * This [graphic](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-money-economy-in-perspective-7dd6.jpg) may be a bit outdated since it’s from 2018, but the point still stands. Even if the crypto market is $2.2 TN, that amount is pretty small if you believe that crypto is going to be a significant form of currency in the future. 
   * Personally, I’ve had to transfer from US banks to banks in China and Korea for my last business and the process is extremely painful and expensive
      * If you’ve ever sent money through crypto to other people, the only tricky part is figuring out the addresses to send to but other than, it’s basically instantaneous and cheap
      * As a result, it’s very easy to imagine crypto growing just based on that use case alone although there are other arguments to be made as well such as Bitcoin being a store of value
   * In addition to this, I believe a big reason the crypto market is growing so fast is because **institutions like hedge funds** which are the ones that move equity markets are rapidly joining the crypto market 
      * At just Coinbase alone, institutions grew from 1000 in 2017 to 7000 in 2020 and even Tesla recently made a $1.5 billion investment into bitcoin
      * These institutions increasingly validate crypto and a rapidly growing market will greatly benefit Coinbase
* The fourth reason to be bullish is that Coinbase has **so many more markets it can enter and assets to add**
   * The company is extremely deliberate and that’s a reason the company is so well trusted as a crypto exchange
   * Coinbase is currently ranked [2nd](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) for spot exchanges on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/) and that’s pretty impressive given Coinbase is in much fewer markets and offers less coins 
      * This is because Coinbase is the number 1 exchange in the US which is where a lot of the world’s capital is in
   * But the point is, there is a lot of room for Coinbase to expand which will further expand the company’s revenue and scale

**The Bear Case**

* First is Coinbase’s dependence on the highly volatile crypto market
   * Now, everyone knows the crypto market is volatile, but the reason this is such a big issue for Coinbase is that as a public company, Coinbase now **needs to manage investor expectations every quarter**
   * As you can see here, [Coinbase’s revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db84a3291d9febc0c7427_Quaterly%20Total%20Revenue.jpg) has been super lumpy over the past few years
   * What this basically means is that as an investor, you’ll need an **iron stomach** to deal with a stock price that will likely rise and fall sharply with the crypto market
* The second risk involves competition
   * Because crypto is such a lucrative industry, there is constant competition from multiple fronts
   * First, there are other crypto exchanges that provide the most direct competition and **while Coinbase is highly regulated, many non-US exchanges are not**
      * This provides non-US crypto exchanges with a competitive advantage because they are able to offer popular products and services with less regulation while still serving the US population
   * Second, are from **financial incumbents** like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, or even financial institutions like JP Morgan
      * If any of these companies start offering crypto trading then that could meaningfully take share from Coinbase
   * Third are from **fintech companies** which are already starting to see significant trading volume
      * Robinhood and Square’s CashApp are big players in the space and PayPal has also recently started to get into the mix 
   * Fourth are **decentralized trading platforms** that allow users to directly buy and sell without the need for a centralized exchange like Coinbase
      * These platforms currently are not as easy to use and aren’t as fast and liquid, but over time, the models are going to improve rapidly with Coinbase even admitting in its S-1 that the company has seen transaction volumes rivaling its own
   * So Coinbase is very well positioned especially in the US market, but **there’s a ton of competition to be wary of,** especially given Coinbase charges the highest fees and those fees are likely going to lower over time
* The third risk is mixed sentiment
   * Overall, Coinbase is generally regarded as the most trusted crypto exchange in the US, but there’s still a lot of hate the the company gets
   * On Coinbase’s subreddit, there are **constant complaints about funds being locked out and accounts not working and users seem to complain most about the lack of customer service and also the company’s high fees**
   * Every crypto exchange has its issues and Coinbase likely has to charge high fees because it’s operating in the US which is highly regulated and expensive, but, I do think Coinbase needs to vastly improve its customer service in order to maintain its customer base (there are talks the company plans to open a customer service center in India)
* The fourth risk is the lack of shareholder voting rights
   * As is the case with many tech companies these days, the **vast majority of voting rights are going to be held by a small number of Class B shareholders**
      * Class B shareholders own 99.2% of voting rights while directors, officers, and 5% shareholders own 60.5% of voting rights which puts a lot of power in the hands of the few
   * To give you an example of why this could be a problem, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong actually took a lot of heat for recently [not allowing political and social discussions at work](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/coinbase-ceo-offers-severance-to-employees-leaving-over-politics.html)
   * Things like this and potential scandals with high level management could lead to potential unrest in the company while shaleholders really won’t have the power to do much

**So is Coinbase a Buy or Sell?**

* Sorry to leave on a bit of a cliffhanger but this requires an overview of Coinbase’s financials and some extensive thoughts on valuation, which I’ll write up later and post as soon as I can.
* In short though, I personally believe Coinbase is a buy from $250-$313 (or at least that's my target range at which I would start a position), which implies a \~$60-$80BN valuation.  Would be great to hear what you all plan to do as well."|investing|Coinbase Deep Dive Diligence - Part 1 of 2 (Qualitative Thoughts)|812.0|0.94
1618440740.0|0.0|t3_mr23mr|29.0|"So I've tried to estimate the 10-year return for holding TSLA shares by projecting growth, margins and EBITDA forward in three scenarios and coming up with an estimated enterprise value and market cap for TSLA in 2030. Hoping to hear some helpful feedback.

Quick disclaimer: I am not a CFA, I don't have a degree in finance (degree in engineering) and this is my first time trying to do this. Obviously don't take this as investment advice.

For the base case scenario, I used analyst estimates for revenue growth in 2021-2023 and then grew it at the rate closer to the projected EV market growth between now and 2027 (22%). I then grew it at 20% for the last 3 years to be conservative. So this is a scenario in which Tesla captures more market share for a few years and then maintains that market share. For EBITDA Margin, I maintained it at 20% until 2026 at which point I let it decline by 1 percentage point a year as I'd expect there to be more competition and Tesla to be selling less luxury cars (higher margin) as a percentage of their sales. 

My base case EBITDA projection for 2030 was then 48.45 Billion USD. For a company that is still growing revenues at 20% albeit without high margins, I gave it a EV/EBITDA multiple of 25, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 1.2 Trillion dollars. This represents a 1.66x multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 77.26 Billion USD. With it's continued higher growth rate, I gave it an EV/EBITDA multiple of 30, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 2.3 Trillion dollars. This represents a 3.18 multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the more pessimistic case, I reduced the growth rate slightly below analyst projections for 2021-2023 and brought down the growth rate to 18% by 2030. I also brought the EBITDA margin down to 15% by 2030. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 44.11 Billion USD. With it's lower growth rate, I gave it a lower EV/EBITDA multiple of 20 giving Tesla an enterprise value of 882 Billion USD. This represents a 1.21x multiple on the original investment.

I gave each of the scenarios a weight--base case: 50%, bull case 30%, and bear case 20%. I'm optimistic on the EV market overall so I wanted to give the bull case a slight advantage. This resulted in a weighted multiple on investment of 2.03x, which represents an 8% annualized rate of return. I found this to be surprising/more bullish than I was expecting, but I would still not invest in Tesla as it does not fit my desired risk/reward profile.

What do you all think? How can I improve my analysis? Is there something about Tesla that would make one of these cases more or less likely?"|investing|My attempt at EBITDA forecast valuation for Tesla (TSLA)|29.0|0.74
1618429220.0|0.0|t3_mqy9tn|15.0|" Hello Everyone,

Currently   the largest holding in my portfolio is Vicinity Motor Corp, you may   have heard of them previously as Grande West Transportation, but they   recently went through a name change to reflect what they do/closer   mirror the name of their buses. [https://ir.grandewest.com/](https://ir.grandewest.com/)

So   Vicinity Motor corp makes Buses - CNG, Diesel and Electric.  They are a   Canadian bus manufacturer who is now breaking into the US market and I   think they are posed for a breakout this year and into next year.

I'll   start with giving some of the business moves that makes me extremely   confident with them and then move into financials and finish with risks   to the company

**Business Moves for 2021**

Vicinity   is looking to break into the American market - they have a plant in   Washington state which is projected to be finished by Q4 of 2021 that is   buy America compliant.  They also have signed a deal with ABC  companies  to distribute their buses and through that have roughly $15  million of  deals that have been signed for the second half of 2021.

They   have signed deals with both New Mexico and the State of Washington to   be an OEM supplier for the transit agencies for those states - both are   statewide contracts.  These deals do not make them an exclusive   supplier, but rather give the transit agencies the ability to buy their   buses from Vicinity.  If they can just get a fraction of these sales   then that will translate to a huge improvement in the revenue for the   company. They also mentioned in [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTQTt6calg&amp;t=454s&amp;ab_channel=SmallcapDiscoveries)   that they are progressing in signing a deal with the state of   California, if signed that would be massive - they somewhat go through   the math, but it looks like the total deal would be up to 2.4 billion in   buses - obviously they wouldn't capture all of that, but if they get a   portion of that along with Washington and New Mexico, it would be   massive.

Now the next big thing   they are doing is making electric buses.  At the moment, they do not   have any electric buses on the road. They are anticipating getting their   first 5 electric buses in June and will use them to Demo to potential   customers and run testing on to make sure that they are good and have  no  issues.  Note that the last time they had Altoona testing done on  their  buses they received best in class.

Lastly,   they are in a good position to capture both the Canadian and US   green/infrastructure bills. These are massive amounts of capital flowing   to bus companies and transit organizations - definitely a boon to the   company/the industry as a whole.

**Financials:**

The   company has a couple of items on the financials that makes me very   bullish and a couple of forward looking items from their recent earnings   call which makes me very excited.

Starting   with the Forward looking items - they have said they are going to have   roughly $50 Million of revenue in the first half of 2021.  That is   roughly double of the revenue in both 2019 and 2020.  I had mentioned   earlier that they have at least an additional $15 Million booked for   Q3/Q4 of this year.  Bringing up their booked revenue to $65 Million as   of April - and those do not include any money from the deals with   Washington and New Mexico. They also received an order for [5 electric buses from Tulane University](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/02/tulane-university-buys-5-vicinity-electric-shuttle-buses/) That would bring them up to most likely about 66.5 Million in revenue for the year that is booked through April.

Now,   before the Q4 earnings were reported, I had one major worry with the   company - their cost of revenue.  I had listened to their Q3 earnings   call and heard that their gross margins would improve due to them   getting out of a deal where they were selling their buses for a   discount.  I wanted to see the impact of this and it was honestly pretty   staggering.  [Here are the Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BUSXD/financials?p=BUSXD)   now the Q4 gross margin includes an impairment of .7 Million. so I   threw that out to get a look at what forward gross margins would be and I   got 33.2%. That is roughly a 5-6X improvement over the previous   quarters - Q3 had a gross profit of 6.3% and 5.7% in Q2.  This is where   the real growth comes in for me - they not only are going to double   their revenue from the previous year in the first half of this year, it   is going to be at much better margins.  Now that would still have them   trading at a fairly generous amount to their forward EBITDA - roughly   about 20X but growing revenue by at least 2.5X YoY and then improving   gross margins by 5-6X makes me think they are still very undervalued -   especially with the incoming catalysts of a NASDAQ uplisting and their   electric buses hitting the market/the market realizing they make green   vehicles.

**Risks:**

* Currently,   it looks like the $50 million in revenue is from a single customer -  at  least that is how I interpret it although that could be incorrect,  so  they will need to work on building relationships with other entities  as  this order and revenue from it dries up.
* They   are trying to break into the American market, and while I see good   signs that they will, their small size and newness to the market may   scare some clients and also means that if they mess up anything they   could really be hurting
* Speaking   of messing things up, their electric bus still has not passed testing   as that will happen in June.  I believe that it will pass with flying   colors based off of the results of their previous buses, but if it   doesn't for some reason they will be in a world of hurt.
* Delays   in completing their American facility in Washington could cause them  to  lose orders or have orders delayed which would cause their stock  price  to drop.

Store count growth: from 2013 to 2020 store count increased from 170 to 360, and expecting to open 20 new stores in 2021. Some of Sprouts' new stores will be in a smaller formats which may increase margins.

Share buybacks: 20% of outstanding shares have already been bought back and recently they were authorized to buy back $300m worth of shares.

Multiples:

TTM eps: 2.43 (trailing p/e of 11) 2020 earnings for many grocery stores were higher than normal because covid closed down restaurants

TTM Revenues: 6.47b (55 per share), with about 4.5% profit margins.

2022: 2.05 (7)

The San Francisco-based lender on Wednesday posted a profit of $4.74 billion for the first quarter, up from $653 million a year earlier. A year ago, Wells Fargo and other big banks set aside billions of dollars to prepare for a coronavirus recession, hammering their profits at the time.

Maybe, I don't have the full picture but it seems their products are only ""put a cool UI and automate some data tasks"".

All  the things I saw in their presentation are perfectly manageable if you  hire proper IT people. We don't need UI to prepare data from different  sources, link the data, run AI models etc. We can do it in days or weeks  not years like they are trying to sell you.

Maybe they will faciliate some tasks for companies without good sized or skilled IT teams, I dont' know...

Their  UI seems very interesting and well designed, I can give that. But I m  sure we will be quicker with a simple linux terminal (joke) :)

I  see their products like ""Channable"" for data flow management but with  all the AI hype (\*\*Channable is a small tool to prepare data to be sent  to shopping marketplaces).

Like I  said, maybe I don't have the full picture based on their presentation  and I don't know any figures related to their valuation etc. But for a  pure technical point, I don't see anything in the core plateform that is  a big whaooo effect (except their UI).

If  I need to think about a road : they maybe will be a 3d engine like  Unreal Engine or Unity but for data linking, preparation, and IA models  (the tool that groups up the techs in a simpler way).. but I have a  doubt.

[Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US)’s first product unveiling of 2021 will take place on April 20, the company said on Tuesday.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant dubbed the event “Spring Loaded” in a media invitation. Apple plans to unveil a new iPad Pro line as early as this month, Bloomberg News [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost) recently. The company has also been working on several other products, including an accessory dubbed AirTags for tracking physical devices and new iMac desktops.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event will be online and streamed via Apple’s website. This will be Apple’s fifth virtual keynote, following last year’s developer conference and separate events for the latest Apple Watch, iPhone 12 and first Macs with Apple’s own M1 processors. Apple is holding its second virtual developer conference in early June, the company said last month.

The new iPad Pros will come in the same 11-inch and 12.9 inch screen sizes as the current models, but will add processors on par with the latest Mac chips, a new MiniLED screen on the larger model, updated cameras, and potentially an upgraded connector for faster syncing of data and compatibility with additional external monitors and storage drives.

The larger iPad Pro has been facing production issues due to the new screen technology and may initially be in short supply, Bloomberg News recently [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display).

The iPad generated $8.4 billion in revenue for Apple during the key holiday quarter of 2020, the most since 2014. Sales jumped on demand from people working and studying from home during the pandemic. As employees and students begin returning to offices and schools in coming months, Apple will be betting on the new iPad models to maintain interest in the tablet line.

At the event, Apple is also likely to announce the release date of iOS 14.5, an upcoming software update that will introduce new privacy protections for ad tracking across apps and websites. The update has irked companies like Facebook Inc., which has said the changes could hurt its advertising business."|investing|Apple to Hold First Product Unveiling of the Year on April 20|1060.0|0.94

Evaluating miners can be daunting at first but they're actually very simple [quantifiable](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/3/12/49782598-16155711719714544_origin.png) operations with very little guesswork. By looking at [current](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176481499887147_origin.png) and [future](https://imgur.com/a/FS884xP) hashrate, electricity costs, and saved bitcoin we can value these companies with high precision at specific bitcoin price points. 

There are two ways to value these stocks. Based on [current hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176654693896902_origin.png) or [projected hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176645878387735_origin.png). Their proper value probably lies somewhere in between. 

With a very very modest 25PE (miners and hot tech stocks often go into the 100's) and bitcoin $100k (lower than most institutional estimates) we can calculate a [3.5-5.1x potential](https://imgur.com/w7uvlo5). 

Miners are a leveraged play on bitcoin like gold miners on gold. Their profit is the difference between the price floor to mine and price of bitcoin. Profitability data can be tracked [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#1y). 

Unlike leveraged bitcoin you can't be washed out. Unlike altc*ins you don't risk picking the wrong blockchain. They combine the upside of altc*ins with the inevitability of bitcoin but somehow get the least attention. This of course also means they are more volatile than bitcoin so you need an iron stomach. 

The public miners are in a race to secure hashrate and cheap power. With announced purchases we can calculate their [income](https://imgur.com/W2gRL0K).

Miners are incentivized to [h*dl bitcoin](https://imgur.com/61rSlV9) and in some cases outright buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. This further increases price appreciation when bitcoin moves for the stocks with a high h*dl. 

Mara and Riot have the highest market caps being on Nasdaq. However, the pre-Nasdaq stocks' [market caps](https://imgur.com/aKzj0PG) are far behind what their hashrate should be valued. There are some massive [price dislocations](https://imgur.com/P9qxdCx) going on because of the Nasdaq barrier. 

[Blonity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJvLknI9JEwW_p4m8xaAow) is a great analyst in the sector and has created an all in one [BMXI indicator](https://imgur.com/V3wWOtS) which calculates the degree of undervalue of each stock based on these hashrate-to-marketcap discrepancies. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzv_eMtviCHnWJ9Irn-nqslzD1XV5xsY) explains in more detail how the indicators work. Note: DGHI &amp; DMGI are new smallcap miners that were recently added and have less history than the rest and I wouldn't recommend making them a main position. 

A Nasdaq uplisting could be explosive for the OTC miners. However, Mara and Riot may outperform in the short term due to better accessibility. In the long term Mara has the most future hashrate secured and will dominate the scene. My strategy is to hold mostly OTC miners now then roll into the Nasdaq miners after the value gaps close. 

The biggest concern about miners (and what previous DDs here got wrong) is that mining is intensely competitive with little moat and they will lose marketshare as global hashpower ramps up. This is unfounded for multiple reasons. 

1. Asics and cheap megawatt energy &amp; facilities are in short supply and they have bought up large shares for months to years into the future. Backlogs are huge.  
1. Bitcoin's price and mining profitability has always appreciated [faster](https://imgur.com/0E73cNv) than the hashrate &amp; difficulty so it's not an issue in the next year 
1. Public money should give them a growth advantage and I asked Blonity to test this hypothesis and indeed they are gobbling up [marketshare](https://imgur.com/rj0yW27).

These companies are also branching out. Argo has purchased a staking company, Hive &amp; Hut8 do some GPU mining which can be used for AI/Rendering computation, some are buying bitcoin like Microstrategy, etc. They will evolve into general blockchain and data companies. 

We can [calculate](https://imgur.com/poG6ZP3) how many times their share price could multiply at $200k bitcoin at various PE ratios. Hot tech companies can have PE's in the 100's. They're currently trading around 3-4.

This is the most asymmetric trade I've ever seen if you are bullish on bitcoin. With Coinbase around the corner I think these companies are going to get a lot of attention soon and the quiet pre-Nasdaq miners could have quite a run.

Another great way to hold these is the [BLOK ETF](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html). It has surprisingly good holdings with all the pre-Nasdaq miners represented in the top 10 and I highly recommend it. It has some good exchanges and straight bitcoin funds as well and they will be [adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKE1tAyCSyo) COIN.

British cyber security firm Darktrace has announced plans of a London listing said to value the company at £3bn ($4.1bn, €3.4bn).

Backed by tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch, the company was founded in 2013 in Cambridge, UK and uses artificial intelligence (AI) to understand IT networks and detect attacks by identifying unusual behaviour.

Darktrace, which counts Rolls-Royce and Coca-Cola among its customers, claims to be the first company to use AI to detect and tackle cybersecurity threats on a large scale.

The company plans to float at least 20 per cent of its shares, with an option to release a further 15 per cent of shares to the market. The money raised will help speed up product development and strengthen the balance sheet, Darktrace said."|investing|Cyber security firm Darktrace aims for $4bn London IPO|68.0|0.87

So let's start with the expectations.

Currently the consensus is for CPI to be 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.

For Core CPI, the expectations are 0.2% month-over-month and 1.5% year-over-year.

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar

Although the Fed's preferred inflation metric is the PCE deflator, they say they do pay attention to several inflation indicators. So these are still important figures.

You also may have heard the Fed say that they expect inflation to be higher in the near term. There's good reason for this. As this report is for March 2021, the year-over-year comparison will be the first significant month of the Covid-19 pandemic, March 2020. In that month, the CPI actually fell by -0.3%. In April 2020, prices fell again by -0.7%. These figures are very unusual, as the spring months usually see price increases. So for the next two months, the year-over-year comparisons are going to be impacted greatly by the very weak spring from 2020.

This is why inflation may seem high than the Fed prefers, but there is indeed a good chance that it is temporary due to the weak year-over-year comparisons. However, the market is priced in at certain assumptions mentioned earlier. If inflation comes in hotter than 0.5% headline and 0.2% core, the market could sell off. Similarly, if it comes in less than those figures, the market could rally.

**The Fundamentals**

Canoo(GOEV) is an electric car company, what makes them unique is the modular electric platform that their vehicles are built on. The modular electric platform appears to have all of the necessary equipment on it for the car to be able to run. This allows Canoo to make cars with more interior space as they do not need an engine in the front or back of the car. Their self claimed goal with this is to allow customers and businesses to use their vehicles in many different ways. Canoo is planning to launch its first consumer vehicle in 2022. Canoo is based in Los Angeles, California and they have 350+ employees on their team.

**The Management**

**Tony Aquila**.

Tony serves as executive chairman and founded Solera Holdings a successful company that provides risk management, asset protection software, services to the automotive industry and property insurance. He has also served as chairman for multiple other companies including Sportradar Group,Aircraft Performance Group,RocketRoute Limited, global aviation services company, and  APG Avionics LLC.

**Mark Aikman**

Mark Serves as Chief Marketing Officer and he has nearly 20 years of experience including a decade at Daimler AG.

## Ulrich Kranz

Ulrich currently serves as CEO, and has worked with the company since 2017 as the company's CTO (chief technical officer). Since 1986 Ulrich has been involved in the car business holding various leadership positions at BMW AG and caused great innovation.

**Peter Savagian**

Peter Serves as the current CTO and has held multiple different leadership positions at companies including  Ampaire, Inc, Electrified Future,Faraday&amp;Future Inc,Sibros Technologies,and General Motors Company. Which are all companies that have to do with automobiles, electric vehicles, or technology closely related to those categories.

[A few other positions that can be seen here](https://investors.canoo.com/company-information/management-team)

**Financials**

Canoo is a company that has not turned a profit but this most likely is largely due to them not releasing any consumer vehicles. What Canoo has done however is reduce their net loss year over year quite dramatically. In 2019 they had a net loss of $182,360(in thousands) that they were able to reduce to $89,818(in thousands) of net loss in 2020, which is nearly 100 thousand less loss than the previous year, this could have been due to COVID-19. They have also increased their cash/Cash equivalents from 29,507(In thousands) to 702,422(in thousands) which is very good growth. 

**Concerns**

On April 12 2021 according to [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/securities-class-action-filed-against-165000354.html): Berman Tabacco has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against Canoo Inc. 

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goev-investor-alert-bronstein-gewirtz-150000588.html) gives more details saying: The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) Canoo had decreased its focus on its plan to sell vehicles to consumers through a subscription model; (2) Canoo would de-emphasize its engineering services business; (3) contrary to prior statements, Canoo did not have partnerships with original equipment manufacturers and no longer engaged in the previously announced partnership with Hyundai; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked reasonable basis at all relevant times.

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/15/young-people-stand-to-make-dismal-returns-on-their-investments

“They estimate that baby-boomers (defined here as those born 1946–64), Generation X (born 1965–80) and Millennials (born 1981–96) have all earned average real returns of at least 5% on equities and at least 3.6% on bonds. The authors then forecast what Generation Z might expect to earn in the coming decades. To do this, they assume that the real return on equities will be equal to the inflation-adjusted return on a risk-free asset (represented by Treasury bills), which they estimate at -0.5%, plus a “risk premium” for buying equities of about 3.5%, for a real return of just 3%. For bonds, the authors assume the current, negative real yields on the index-linked variety. All of this adds up to annualised returns for Gen Z of a mere 2% on a 70:30 portfolio of stocks and bonds—not even a third of the historical return of the baby boomers (see chart). These guesses could prove too pessimistic, but perhaps not dramatically so.”

**Company Overview:**

Axesome  Therapeutics is a bio-pharmaceutical company that develops therapies  for managing a wide range of Central Nervous System disorders. It had  its IPO in 2015 but saw its market cap skyrocket in early and late 2019  around impressive results of clinical trials on its most hyped product,  an oral medication to treat depression. They intend to market their  products in the U.S. internally and partner with other companies to  market them internationally. Their development strategy is to combine  existing medicinal ingredients in novel ways with their proprietary  improvements. By using ingredients already proven safe and effective,  they believe they can reduce regulatory risk, decrease development  costs, and increase time to market. Unlike some emerging  bio-pharmaceutical companies, they are not reliant on a single product  or 2 as they have 5 different ones currently in development. Every  product has had at least 1 successful clinical trial, and their 2 top  products have been either submitted for New Drug Application (NDA) or  are nearing submission.

Their  executive management team and board of directors have a good mix of  medical expertise and previous business experience in similar companies.  Their top-level management comprises 7 people, including 2 with an MD, 2  with a PharmD, and 2 with an MBA. The CEO previously was a partner at  Healthcor, an asset management company focused on healthcare stocks with  a portfolio of $2.5B. Their board comprises 4 people, including 2 with  an MD and 1 with a pharamacology PhD. The director previously served as  President and co-CEO of United Therapeutics where he led their IPO.  United Therapeutics (UTHR) now has a yearly revenue of $1.5B and market  cap of $9B.

**FDA Approval Overview:**

Here’s a brief and generalized explanation of how drugs get approved by the FDA.

Phase 1 Trial: The main point is to make sure the drug is safe, although efficacy is also measured.

Phase 2 Trial: The main point is to make a preliminary determination whether the drug works and is safe.

Phase  3 Trial: The main point is to expand the scope of Phase 2 and make a  statistically significant determination whether the drug works and is  safe.

NDA Preparation: The company  gathers a ton of information about the drug, including data taken from  clinical trials as well as information about manufacturing and  marketing.

NDA Submission: After  submission, the FDA has 60 days to determine if it has the requisite  information. If it does, then it is accepted for review.

NDA  Review: The FDA tries to review 90% of its applications within 1 year  of submission. However, reviews are not done on a first-come,  first-serve basis as some can be prioritized for early review. Those  prioritized include drugs marked with Breakthrough Therapy Designation,  and the FDA tries to review 90% of those applications within 6 months of  submission.

COVID-19 slowed the  review process last year and created a backlog of of pending reviews  because it requires the FDA to visit manufacturing and clinical sites,  among other things. It shouldn’t be an issue going forward with  vaccination rates rising and restrictions easing across the country, but  the backlog will need to be navigated.

NDA Approval: After approval, the drug can be marketed and commercialized according to guidelines set forth by the FDA.

**Product Development:**

AXS-05:  An oral medication to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is one  of the most common mental health disorders, affecting about 17 million  people in the U.S. Incidence of depression was also markedly higher in  the past year during COVID-19, so there may be a residual increase in  the following years. There are many existing treatments for it, but  their side effects and the extent of treatment-resistant depression  (TRD) have opened the door to other emerging treatments, including  ketamine, psilocybin, and AXS-05. AXS-05 is a combination of bupropin  (i.e. an existing generic anti-depressant available under brand name  Wellbutrin) and dextromethorpan (i.e. an active ingredient used in cough  syrup).

While ketamine and  psilocybin show promise, they are likely a ways off from widespread  adoption. AXS-05, on the other hand, has already completed several Phase  2 and 3 Trials and their positive results prompted a Breakthrough  Therapy Designation. In July 2020, they announced a successful meeting  with the FDA to discuss pre-submission of their NDA. In early 2021, they  submitted their NDA. Based on the drug’s use of already tested  ingredients, results from their trials, and their meeting with the FDA,  they believe their application will be accepted and approved in  relatively short order.

AXS-05 is  also being developed to treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) agitation and  tobacco cessation. It should be noted there are no FDA-approved drugs to  treat AD agitation, which affects about 4 million people in the U.S.  out of the 6 million with AD. If approved, it would become the first and  only one to treat it. For the treatment of AD agitation, they have  completed a Phase 3 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough Therapy  designation. For the treatment of tobacco cessation, they have a Phase 2  Trial in progress.

AXS-07: An  oral medication to treat migraines. Migraines are one of the most common  illnesses, affecting about 37 million people in the U.S. AXS-07  contains a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, a serotonin inhibitor,  and an enzyme to speed up absorption of the agents. There are several  existing treatments for migraines, but this one hopes to separate itself  by being quicker-acting while being at least as effective as the  others. Given how quickly migraines can appear and ramp up to high  levels of pain, time to effectiveness is a major consideration.

They  have completed a physician survey which confirmed the unmet need for  better migraine treatment and have a Phase 3 Trial in progress. In  December 2020, they announced a successful meeting with the FDA around  pre-submission of their NDA. As of now, they are preparing their NDA  submission.

AXS-09: An oral  medication to treat to-be-determined CNS disorders. They have completed a  Phase 1 Trial. They have significantly reduced funding for this drug’s  development in the past 2 years after the success of their other  products, and it’s looking like this one may not come to fruition.

AXS-12:  An oral medication to treat narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a relatively rare  disorder, affecting about 185,000 people in the U.S. AXS-12 is a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is owned  by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use it.  They have completed a Phase 2 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough  Therapy designation.

AXS-14:  An  oral medicaiton to treat fibromyalgia.  Fibromyalgia is a common  disorder affecting about 5 million people in the U.S. AXS-14 is also a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is also  owned by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use  it. They have completed a Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial.

In  November 2020, they announced a partnership with Veeva Systems to  develop a digital-centric commercialization platform. Veeva has a  lengthy history of successfully supporting similar systems, including  companies such as GSK, Eli Lilly, Merck, Bayer, Cardinal Health,  AstraZeneca, and more.

To sum up,  they have 5 products with 7 therapeutic purposes, all of which have at  least 1 successful clinic trial. In addition, 3 have Breakthrough  Therapy Designation, 1 is nearing NDA submission, and 1 has been  submitted for NDA. Their most hyped product, AXS-05 to treat MDD, has  been submitted, and AXS-07 to treat migrations is nearing submission.  MDD affects about 17 million people in the U.S. and migraines affect  about 37 million, so the potential market is huge for these drugs.  They’re ramping up commercialization resources to prepare for their  approval.

**Finances:**

Their operating costs have increased significantly  over the years as their product lineup has expanded and progressed  toward FDA approval. It’s not likely to decrease from here as they will  need to build up their manufacturing and marketing after approval of  their NDAs. However, their 2020 R&amp;D figure is slightly elevated as  it includes a one-time $10.2MM cost for their Pfizer agreement. In  addition, the majority of the G&amp;A increase from 2019 to 2020 is due  to increased stock compensation for employees.

Their  operations have been financed by equity offerings and loans. Most  recently, they did a public offering in December 2019 after their stock  price skyrocketed and sold 2.3 million shares for $87 apiece, netting  them $200.1MM. In September 2020, they received a $225MM loan from  Hercules Capital. The loan will not have principal due to be paid back  until 2023, but the amount owed can be increased based on timelines of  NDA approvals and revenue benchmarks. As a part of the loan, the company  agreed to indefinitely maintain a market cap of at least $2B starting  at 1 year after approval of their AXS-05 or AXS-07 NDA. Given their  current market cap of $1.98B, it seems they think the market cap should  be significantly higher post-approval than it is currently. Overall,  they state their current resources should fund their anticipated  operations into 2024, including expected costs for the commercial launch  of AXS-05 and AXS-07. As such, I don’t expect another offering in the  near future.

The company has zero  revenue, and its products closest to commercialization have yet to be  approved by the FDA. If and when they are approved, they will still need  to be manufactured and marketed before they will start making money. In  addition, not-insignificant portions of the company’s future revenue  will be used to pay back their debtors.

According to an [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594716)  from JAMA, in 2013 the U.S. spent $71.1B on treating depression,  including $22.8B on pharmaceuticals. $7.3B was spent on treating  migraines, including $2.9B on pharmaceuticals. These figures have  undoubtedly increased since the 2013 study given inflation, population  growth, and the increased focus on mental health treatment in the U.S.  It’s unknown if the company’s products will be successfully  commercialized, but the potential revenue is high if it can attain a  reasonable market share. Using the 2013 figures with CPI inflation (14%  since 2013) and World Bank country population growth (3.9% since 2013), a  5% U.S. market share in depression and migraine pharmaceutical  treatment would produce $1.52B yearly revenue. In addition, they may  gain revenue from international commercialization and their other  products. In particular, getting approval for AXS-05 to treat AD  agitation could be a large source of potential revenue.

Biotech companies tend to run high P/S ratios, and you can see the [current ratio](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;sg=healthcare&amp;v=120&amp;o=name)  for the sector is 16.8. Emerging ones often run much higher than that.  It’s very difficult to predict revenue for a company with none yet, but  if they were able to achieve $400M by the end of 2024 with a P/S of 20,  they would have a market cap of $8B (304% increase over the current  value). That figure assumes a lot of things going right and should in no  way be expected, but it shows the kind of speculation that’s driving  its current valuation.

**Stock History and Ownership:**

The  stock IPO’d at $9 in 2015. It slowly decreased until the beginning of  2019 which saw it jump back to its original IPO price. This was because  they announced positive results from their Phase 2 Trial of AXS-05 to  treat MDD and presented their results at the Annual Biotech Showcase.  The price had impressive upwards movement throughout 2019 with the  release of more good news, but saw it skyrocket up to $100 in December  2019 based on positive results from their Phase 3 Trial of AXS-05. They  used this opportunity to do a public offering, which only slightly  decreased the price. When the company recovered in mid-2020 after the  COVID-19 drop, it had uneven, but overall slightly downward, movement  for the rest of 2020. It closed the year at $81. Since then, it has  started to move downward more sharply until hitting the current price at  $52.99 with a market cap of $1.98B. Note that there has not been an  offering since 2019, so the recent drop in price is not due to share  dilution. In addition, short volume has no significantly increased  during the recent price drop and has stayed at an average of around 12%  of total volume.

AXSM  has a large insider and institutional ownership at 21% and 64%  respectively. No insiders have sold their shares even as the stock hit  its ATH around $100 and slowly fell to its current price. On the  contrary, their CFO and Board Director purchased an additional $110,000  worth of shares last year at market value when the price was around $80.  Institutional owners have also largely held onto the stock, continuing  to accumulate while it was in the $70-85 range. Among institutional  owners, the largest are Antecip Capital (i.e. a company that loaned them  money years ago in exchange for shares before their market cap  skyrocketed), Vanguard, Venrock Healthcare Capital, Blackrock, and  Iridian Asset Management. I should note that Sabby Management is the 6th  largest institutional owner at 5% of the shares. It’s known as a  short-seller. However, the market cap is large enough that I don’t  expect it to be a major consideration like it could be for a micro cap  stock.

[MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AXSM/price-target/)  shows 12 analyst price targets within the past year, including 11 Buys  and 1 Sell and ranging from $66 to $200. This includes 3 since the start  of 2021, all Buys: Jeffries at $129 on 1/8, Mizuho at $118 on 3/2, and  Morgan Stanley at $104 on 3/8.

There  has been no significant negative news about the company in 2021, and  short volume has remained fairly constant during the recent price drop  at an average of around 12%. However, the entire emerging  healthcare/biotech sector has been down since its peak in early 2021, as  can be approximately seen by the ETF SBIO above. The slide in stock  price can likely be attributed to some combination of the following: 1)  Poor recent sector performance; 2) A small miss in earnings for Q4 2020  (EPS loss of .78 compared to expected loss of .73); 3) A drop in  hype-driven growth as shareholders haven’t received continuous positive  PR like last year; and 4) Delays in expected NDA timelines. The AXS-05  and AXS-07 NDAs were expected to be submitted in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021  respectively, but both were delayed by a quarter. In addition, there has  been no update from AXSM that their AXS-05 NDA was accepted for filing.  I believe this is more likely to be related to the FDA COVID-19 backlog  rather than an issue with the filing, but the price action implies it  carries an additional risk. Note that only [4%](https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/PS143806/FDA-RefuseToFile-Decisions-Are-Rare-But-CMC-And-Ignoring-Agency-Advice-Are-Often-Triggers)  of NDAs are rejected for filing, and AXS-05 should be even less likely  to be rejected than the average NDA given its Breakthrough Therapy  Designation.

Short-term,  it’s hard to predict what the price action will be. An announcement of  whether the AXS-05 NDA was accepted could happen any day now. I could  not find an exact date for when it was submitted, so it is unclear when  the 60-day benchmark for the decision will be reached. The more amount  of time that goes by without an update, the more the stock may  potentially drop. If it’s rejected, which I believe is possible but very  unlikely, the price would likely drop further. If it’s accepted, the  price is likely to at least stabilize and could start an upward trend.  Assuming it’s accepted, its approval determination likely in the summer  or fall will have another significant impact on its price. Approval  rates are very high, as most drugs fail before they reach this phase. As  you can see from this [chart](https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf),  drugs that treat other diseases and reach NDA submission achieve  approval 88.4% of the time. Given that AXS-05 has held many successful  trials including multiple at the Phase 2 and 3 levels, it was given  Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, and AXSM had a successful  pre-submission meeting with the FDA, I believe the chance of approval is  likely even higher. The stock previously jumped from $40 to $100 on the  positive results of its most recent AXS-05 trial, and it’s possible  there could be a similar jump once it gets approved. Other short-term  considerations include: 1) The filing, acceptance, and approval of the  AXS-07 NDA. The filing should occur in Q2; 2) Results from a AXS-07  trial to treat migraines and AXS-05 trial to treat TRD in Q2-Q3; and 3) A  pre-submission FDA meeting for AXS-14 to treat fibromyalgia in Q2-3.

I  don’t rely heavily on technical analysis, but I know others do and it’s  worth considering. The technical indicators are not good. Some good  ones are that the trading volume has remained fairly constant over the  past few months as the price has fallen, indicating that the price  decrease is not due to a significant dip in volume. The RSI(14) is 28,  indicating oversold. If you squint, the chart could be interpreted as  forming a falling wedge, which could be a bullish indicator. However,  the stock fell below a previous support level in early March and has not  stabilized with a new resistance level. The SMA50 crossed below the  SMA200 at the same time, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD line has  been slightly below the signal line for most of 2021 and both are in the  negative, indicating a bearish trend.

**Summary:**

To  sum up, this is a bio-pharmaceutical company with an exciting product  lineup, including a novel drug to treat depression that may get FDA  approval as early as this summer and a novel drug to treat migraines  that may get FDA approval as early as the fall. The cons are that it has  debt, no current revenue, currently no FDA-approved products, and is  still valued at $1.98B. The pros are that it has enough resources to  last until 2024, insiders and institutional owners have not sold their  shares even when the price was near double its current value, analyst  price targets are well above the current price, the chances for FDA  approval look high, and even a small fraction of the relevant U.S.  market share for their drugs nearing approval would create billions in  yearly revenue. Its short-term downward price movement is concerning and  represents some potential risk, but it also has created an opportunity  to buy in at a price that has the potential to be 50+% higher later in  the year.

What the exhibition season has revealed so far about the  SNPW teams

\-  The Company’s subsidiary Medrecycler RI, Inc. continues to progress  through the regulatory process  for the approval to construct a 48,000  SF state-of-the-art pyrolysis  facility expected to process 70 tons of  medical waste per day. With approval and the completion of financing,  the project should be operational by the end of 2021

\-  One man who reviewed the tech of Medrecycler has enough faith in the   technology and business plan, that he sees fit to committed 17 MILLION   DOLLARS to buy all the Rhode Island bonds to finance the project.

\-  Many cities have shown faith in the LONG TERM VALUE of Street Smart  outdoor advertising to award them decade long contracts.  Street Smart  is expanding and adding new services to it;s product.

“NVIDIA today announced its first data center CPU, an Arm-based processor that will deliver 10x the performance of today’s fastest servers on the most complex AI and high performance computing workloads.

The result of more than 10,000 engineering years of work, the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU is designed to address the computing requirements for the world’s most advanced applications — including natural language processing, recommender systems and AI supercomputing — that analyze enormous datasets requiring both ultra-fast compute performance and massive memory. It combines energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with an innovative low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with great efficiency.

“Leading-edge AI and data science are pushing today’s computer architecture beyond its limits – processing unthinkable amounts of data,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Using licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data center to advance AI. NVIDIA is now a three-chip company.”

Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, announced that it will launch a full-scale, fully driverless delivery service starting in 2023. The company, a subsidiary of Intel, is joining forces with self-driving delivery startup Udelv to run this new service.

Deliveries will be made using a new type of cabin-less vehicle called The Transporter. While manufacturing plans are still in flux, Mobileye and Udelv say they will produce 35,000 Transporters between 2023–2028 — a signal of their seriousness to launch a driverless delivery system at scale.

“This is a real commercial deployment,” Jack Weast, vice president of automated vehicle standards at Mobileye, told The Verge. “Thirty-five thousand units starting in 2023 that will fully integrate our self driving system for commercial use for automated goods delivery.”

“This is a real commercial deployment”

Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system features a full-sensor suite of 13 cameras, three long-range LiDARs, six short-range LiDARs, and six radar. It also includes the Israeli company’s EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.

The company is also testing autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well.

“The design of our self driving systems is based on this concept called true redundancy,” Weast said. “Unlike most everyone else, where you need to have your radar, LIDAR, and camera operating in perfect unison in order to operate, we have independent subsystems between our camera systems alone, and then the radar and LIDAR subsystems alone. ...If either one of the subsystems is unable to properly detect an object, the other one will be able to. Then you can provide a better, safer experience.”

Udelv is an interesting choice for a partner for Mobileye. One of the few AV startups that has yet to be acquired by a larger company, Udelv has been testing autonomous delivery vans in a variety of markets across the US over the last few years, including Oklahoma City, Arizona, and the Bay Area in California. Udelv said it has completed 20,000 deliveries for merchants in the cities where it has operations.

The company currently uses retrofitted cargo vans to make its deliveries, but starting in 2023, it will start to roll out the cabin-less Transporters as part of its deal with Mobileye. The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers, similar to the drone vehicles we’ve seen from companies like Nuro and Einride. The vehicle is built on a modular electric platform, or skateboard, that can be adjusted to fit a variety of vehicle chassis.

The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers

Udelv isn’t releasing some pertinent specs for the Transporter, like range, battery size, or the overall weight of the vehicle. The vehicle will be compatible with DC fast charging and will have a top speed of 65 mph. A spokesperson said that Udelv will announce its manufacturing plans for the Transporter at a later date.

While the Transporter will be fully autonomous, it won’t be completely alone in the wilderness. Udelv says the vehicle will have ultra-low-latency teleoperation capabilities, meaning a remote operator can offer a prompt to the vehicle if it gets tripped up.

That said, Weast said the Mobileye / Udelv delivery service won’t be limited by geography when it launches in 2023 — meaning it will be able to drive wherever it needs, in all types of conditions.

“What this announcement really underscores is the commercial maturity and readiness of the Mobileye self driving system solution,” he said. “It is ready to scale at large, across tens of thousands of vehicles, multiple states, all the retail store partners in all cities, not geofenced or limited in any way.”"|investing|Intel’s Mobileye will launch a fully driverless delivery service in 2023.

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024. 

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM). 

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021. 

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+

I’ve covered the shipping sector extensively on Seeking Alpha for nearly 10 years and am also on Twitter (@mintzmyer). I enjoyed the conversation on here a couple months ago and figured I'd add another update. I also have a new webinar video available on YouTube, but I don't think I'm allowed to link that?

Nick First (@allthingsventured on Twitter) has recently written another new article on top pick Navios Partners with his own financial projections- highly recommend:

Some important tidbits;

&gt;The stock had lost almost one-third of its value since Beijing launched a series of investigations into the company last November.



&gt;The price of Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares rose as much as 9% in morning trading, reflecting a belief by investors and analysts that the record fine draws a line for now under Beijing's regulatory action against one of the country's tech giants.



&gt;...noted that the regulator has made a point that it will no longer tolerate some of the hidden rules in the e-commerce economy, which makes it more difficult for companies like Alibaba to sustain their double-digit growth. But the upside is that the regulator is unlikely to impose further penalties of this scale on Alibaba in at least the next three years if Alibaba follows its instructions

&gt;Robin Zhu, China internet analyst at AB Bernstein in Hong Kong, said the penalty clears the air for investors.

-	The negative CCP attention and ongoing regulatory risk remain in place and unchanged. That’s a reason for the stock to go down or trade flat, not an argument for upside potential. 

-	The fundamentals of the company are the same as they’ve been the last few months. No new revenue drivers or cost savings measures have been revealed that would indicate a change from the recent status quo. That’s an argument for the stock to trade flat or go down. Not an argument for upside potential.

What’s the bull case for BABA besides “It was higher before, so it will be higher again” or “it’s already fallen a lot, why would it fall anymore?” Those are valid hopes, but not good reasons to think that a course reversal is imminent.

1618114299.0|0.0|t3_mok1fb|69.0|"Mastech Digital is a high level IT staffing and Data management/analytics firm.  Its market cap is $200m making it a micro/small cap firm.  I think that it is on the cusp of big things.

FCF CAGR:  53.4% over 10 growth periods, 31.3% @ 7yrs,  and 111.3% @ 3 years.  BVPS CAGR at 10, 7, 3 years is 14.6%, 24.7%, and 28% respectively.  EPS is 28.1%, 9.5%, and 73.1% over those growth periods.  Revenue Growth Rate is 10.5%, 8.9%, and 9.5%.  Return on Equity (ROE) grew at 11.5% compounded over 10 years and 40.4% over the last 3 years.  At the 7 year mark ROE spiked because the company bought back over 600K shares.  That skews the ROE CAGR for that time span.  Its Long-Term Debt to Earnings sits at value of 1.35, and its ROIC is 0.35.  Yahoo Finance has analysts predictions of 18% annual growth over the next five years.

Mastech Digital did have a flat year in 2020 due to Covid-19.  Their revenue growth was flat YoY from 2019 and they did miss their EPS by $0.03.  This has lead to the stock trading between $16.00 to $18.00 per share so far this year.

Two discounted calcs that I ran with a 15% compounded rate of return on the company put its current value between $32.00 to $44.00.  Factor in a huge Margin of Safety and that puts my buy range between $16.00 - $22.00.

Mastech Digital is a minority owned business and I recall reading it has a higher than average number of women in its senior positions (although as of this posting I cannot find my source on that second piece).

2020 was an incredibly tough year for many businesses.  Staffing agencies suffered across most if not all sectors.  Despite this, Mastech Digital's financials, while down, were not terrible compared YoY and their overall profit margin increased.  This suggests to me that their cost controls allow them to absorb significant economic down turns, and they can compete effectively in their market from a pricing standpoint.  There is a marketable advantage in that the company is minority owned and they recognize the value of women in upper management roles.  As 2021 shows an economy that is ramping up I believe demand for highly skilled IT staff is going to explode.  Companies that put off data management and data analytics consulting will move forward with those plans.  Mastech Digital is going to have an amazing year, and I'm excited to own a piece of the company.

I put about 6% of my non-retirement portfolio into this company and I'm thinking of putting in a little bit more.  I would love to hear your feedback.

1618114213.0|0.0|t3_mok0m1|38.0|"A few relevant points I've been mulling over:

1. It seems easier to identify really shitty companies than to identify winners.
2. When holding a broad market index fund, the worst performing members tend to do *really* badly. For example, [in Q3 2020, when SPY rose by almost 9%, the lowest performing decile of SPY dropped by 16.65% on a cap-weighted basis and 17.75% on a equal-weighted basis.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4377332-50-worst-s-and-p-500-stocks-of-3q)

So here is a strategy I thought of: holding most of your portfolio in a broad market index fund as the Bogleheads suggest, but then *picking losers* to take out short positions on with, say, 10-20%, to open short positions on a handful of losers, with the sizes of the short positions being in proportion to their relative size in the index.

Mind you, that doesn't necessarily means straight up short-selling commons. It could mean puts, or any short delta options strategy.

You still have to pick stocks, but you don't have to pick *winners*, which all the responsible financial advice seems to tell us is difficult to impossible. You only have to pick losers. If you can even pick one loser, while putting the rest of your portfolio in the index fund, you'll have alpha over the index fund.

My questions are:

1. What are the flaws in this strategy? I imagine this will depend specifically on what kind of short positions you open.
2. Is there already a name for this strategy?"|investing|Picking losers- Holding a broad market index fund, then shorting a handful of individual members - thoughts on this strategy?|38.0|0.78

1618104600.0|0.0|t3_mohir3|1457.0|"Which is the better investment, owning a home or owning stocks? If you ask most Americans, chances are they prefer the former.

A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York examined consumer preferences toward being a homeowner and how their attitudes have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were asked to rate which was the better investment — a home or financial assets such as a stocks — and what factors contributed to their choice.

The study found that over 90% of respondents preferred owning their primary residence rather than investing in the stock market. A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&amp;P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

Original Article: [https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers) 

 Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital got much smaller in 2020, according to new regulatory filings. 

If there’s any lingering doubt about how awful 2020 was for short sellers, recently released securities filings make the pain abundantly clear.

Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital — both of which started 2020 with around $1 billion in regulatory assets — ended the year a shadow of their former selves.

Chanos, arguably the most well-known short seller in the world, lost more than 50 percent of its assets last year. Kynikos ended 2020 with about $405 million in regulatory assets under management, down from around $932 million the prior year, according to annual ADV filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The long bull market has punished Chanos for years. In 2018, when *Institutional Investor* profiled him, Kynikos ran just under $2 billion, having already lost almost three-quarters of his assets since the financial crash of 2008, when it ran $7 billion.

\[*II* Deep Dive: [How Jim Chanos Uses Cynicism, Chutzpah — and a Secret Twitter Account — to Take on Markets (and Elon Musk)](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1b00ynrgtn05r/How-Jim-Chanos-Uses-Cynicism-Chutzpah-and-a-Secret-Twitter-Account-to-Take-on-Markets-and-Elon-Musk)\]

Kynikos is heavily diversified, and runs several funds, including one that also goes long via indexes. Short positions rarely are more than 5 percent of the total portfolio. And his short-only fund, Ursus, is a small portion of the regulatory assets. It’s now only about $27 million, according to the ADV, down from about $59 million at the end of 2019.

That said, last year Chanos’s most notable loss was his Tesla short. Elon Musk’s electric car company skyrocketed by more than 700 percent last year, and Chanos — long a Tesla foe — had to scramble.

In January he told CNBC the firm had transformed his short into puts — a common strategy when short sellers are forced to cover their stock shorts. (This year, Tesla is down, but by just 3 percent.)

One bright spot for Chanos in 2020 was his Wirecard short. He told the Financial Times last summer that he made $100 million on that short when the German fintech company collapsed in scandal in June. 

Sophos had an even more dramatic decline than Kynikos. 

The firm started 2020 as the [world’s largest short seller](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1q3cxqlbmltyl/The-World-s-Biggest-Short-Selling-Hedge-Fund-Is-Scaling-Back) with $1.16 billion in regulatory assets under management. But by year end, the firm was winding down some positions and scaling back, as *Institutional Investor* previously reported. Sophos ended 2020 with $258 million, according to its ADV.

Carruthers, who ran the short book for Dan Loeb at Third Point before starting Sophos, launched his short-biased firm in 2014 with $200 million, including a seed investment from Yale University’s endowment.

Another short seller that couldn’t stave off the pain was Fahmi Quadir’s Safkhet Capital. 

Last year Quadir told *II* that she had wagered [25 percent](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m97rvgqnn94q/fahmi-quadir-s-winning-wirecard-short) of the fund’s capital on its Wirecard short, which had been the largest contributor to the fund’s gains since launch in 2018.

That didn’t stop the bleeding at Safkhet, which ended 2020 with about $27 million, down from almost $85 million in regulatory assets under management at the end of 2019, according to its ADV filings. 

It’s unclear how much of these declines were due to performance and how much was caused by redemptions.

Given the complicated way the regulatory assets under management are calculated for short sellers, the numbers themselves may be overstated when it comes to the actual capital these funds have under management.

Chanos, Carruthers, and Quadir did not respond to requests for comment.

One short seller said that many shorts got caught out last year by focusing on what he called “discretionary” and “story names,” like Tesla and other highflying tech stocks.

“Many short sellers were short biotech, and these stocks went up four fold,” he said. “None of these guys were short banks or energy.”

According to the short seller, sector choice was what mattered most in 2020.  “Short tech or healthcare was terrible,” he said. “You wanted to be short energy and banks.”

But, he noted, “this year that has reversed completely.”"|investing|Assets Have Tanked at Two of the World’s Biggest Short Sellers|293.0|0.94

The regulator warned funds that its review had turned up a range of issues where stated approaches of funds or advisors did not match actions. That included examples with how firms handled proxy voting on behalf of investors, as well as ""unsubstantiated and potentially misleading claims"" regarding socially responsible investment strategies.

The alert is the latest in a series of actions the agency has taken to incorporate climate risks and social and governance issues into its framework since the inauguration President Joe Biden.

Last month, the SEC deployed a team to police climate risk disclosure issues. It has also launched an effort to update guidance for public companies on how they share information with investors on climate risk and made the topic a priority for 2021 examinations.

Socially responsible funds have grown more popular with investors in recent years. A record $51 billion flooded into sustainable U.S. funds in 2020 alone, according to Morningstar. But critics have said that some may overstate their credentials to attract cash.

The SEC's exam staff, which is continuing its review, found instances where firms did not have formal processes in place for ESG investing, though they claimed to. In some cases, the SEC said advisors did not have ways to ""reasonably track"" or screen for investments in certain industries.

In the case of proxy voting, the SEC said it found instances where some investors were told they could vote separately on ESG-related proposals, but then were never given that chance."|investing|U.S. SEC review of socially responsible funds finds 'potentially misleading' claims|87.0|0.91

I'm tired of daily DD posts on companies that are at ATH, so here's a mini-DD on one that is still heavily discounted from Covid. And of course...this is not investment advice, do your own due diligence.

Let's look at where they made their business in 2020:

- $1.9 billion in revenue in orthopedics: mainly knee implants, hip implants, &amp; trauma devices.

- $1.3 billion in sports medicine

- $1.3 billion in wound management

So we have a company that makes most of their revenue in sports, injuries, and hip/knees. Literally all things that were put on halt due to Covid. As to be expected, 2020 was a terrible year for them, with revenue down 11.2% and EPS down 25%. They also under-performed all their larger peers (i.e. Striker, Zimmer Biomet) whom thanks to more diversified products were not hit as hard.

I believe most of their under-performance is due to events that are transitory:

- Decline in sports injuries due to Covid.

- Postponement of knee/hip surgeries due to Covid.

- Brexit (they are a UK company)

- Inability to effectively run their sales due to Covid &amp; lockdowns.


Let's look at some headwinds that I think the market is not factoring in:

- They have actually increased their R&amp;D budget by nearly 5% during Covid, while most other device companies are tightening.

- The UK is planning to increase corporate taxes to 25% in 2023, however they will have a temporary 130% super-deduction for plant/equipment through March 2023. Meanwhile, UK plans no change to their 13% credit on R&amp;D. I believe SNN, a device manufacturer, will be an out-sized beneficent of this change in tax policy.

- Potential buyout opportunity from one of the larger device makers.

Finally, SNN's debt looks reasonable, and Price/Sales ratio is literally almost at the same spot it was in 2014/2015..a rarity in this market. And their revenue growth has slowly climbed from $3.8 billion in 2008 to $5.1 billion in 2019, only falling down to $4.5 billion in 2020. So 2020 was, other than a small drop in 2012, the only year they had a major decline in revenue.

If it's not clear by now I am long SNN. I purchased after Covid and planning for a long term hold...now I'm waiting for schools to re-open, sports to come back in full force, and for people to get injured again rather than sit at home in their bubble. It's only a matter of time before people are playing hockey, or recreational soccer.

**Wrestlemania 37** (WWE) is this weekend and returning with a live audience. One of the marquee matches: Big E vs Apollo Crews in a Nigerian Drum Fight. I don't know exactly what a Nigerian Drum Fight is, but I smell $$$ for the sports-injury device company Smith+Nephew."|investing|Smith &amp; Nephew (SNN) - Sports injury/hip-replacement play still over 20% discounted from Covid|14.0|0.76

(C+C appreciated, as I had a lot of fun researching and writing this) 

Stock Ticker: NVS

Market: NYSE 

Name: Novartis

Category; Pharmaceuticals

Why investigate this stock? 

With the opioid crisis and its ramifications coming into the media spotlight, there has been an increasing body of research into the use of suboxone for treatment of opioid dependence disorder (ODD). For those of you unfamiliar with suboxone, it is a combination of buprenorphine-naloxone. This medication acts as a partial opioid agonist, and the naloxone component helps prevent abuse. In toxicology and ""Medication Assisted Treatment"" circles, it is becoming favored over methadone due to decreased side effect profile and decreased potential for abuse. Recently, some states have significantly expanded training programs so providers can easily obtain an “X waiver”, which is a qualification required for a medical provider to prescribe suboxone. This suggests that it will be increasingly used in Emergency Departments to initiate ODD treatment, and it will see increasing use in the outpatient clinic setting. 

So why Novartis?

For those of you familiar with Suboxone’s history, it is actually made by the drug company Reckitt Benckiser. However, recently they authorized a generic version which is to be distributed by, you guessed it, Novartis (technically a subsidiary Sandoz, but all traded under the ticker NVS)

[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:\~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior).

I’m not saying that generic suboxone is going to be “the next big thing”, however I think it will be mainstay of ODD treatment moving forward in the US given low cost, increasing ease of access, and low(er) side effect profile when compared to other medications for ODD. (Some of you may remember Vivitrol aka long acting Naltrexone, see the head to head vs suboxone here: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext))

Now let’s look into some aspects of the stock itself. 

P/E Ratio: \~ 24 

S/p 500 P/E: \~ 34 

I like to look at the P/E ratio as a good starting point to see if the stock is over/under valued compared to its earnings. This can suggest the ability to weather downturns in a market that trends towards over-valuing stocks compared to their real world earnings. 

Next, the relative strength index (RSI). For those of you unfamiliar it is a momentum indicator (I have my own opinions on momentum investing, which I can talk about in a different post). Whether you fall on the side of a value investor or a momentum investor, I think it’s an interesting index to take a look at for any stock, and can help you “time” your purchase. **Remember, there is no end all be all market index.** Regardless, the RSI was developed in 1978 and evaluates price changes to determine if a stock is overbought or oversold. The RSI is listed from 0-100, with a value &lt; 30 suggesting that a stock is undervalued, and should be bought. A value &gt; 70 suggests a stock is overvalued and should be sold. If you’re interested, take a look into how it is calculated to see why a higher RSI suggests overvalue. 

Anyways, the RSI of Novartis as of this post is 54.4, with a steady trend upwards since February. So what does that suggest? Basically that it is neither overbought or oversold, but has a trend towards being overbought, which doesn’t help us much. . 

Here’s a few good resources to check RSI on stocks you’re interested in: 

[https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&amp;tab\_name=rsi](https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&amp;tab_name=rsi)

[https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&amp;uv=100563](https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&amp;uv=100563)

Looking at the financials of NVS for Q4, they are reassuring. 

See here for financial stats, but they can easily be googled otherwise: 

[https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo)

The company demonstrated strong Q4 performance, with increases in Revenue, Net Income, and Profit Margins. However, using the golden rule that **past performance is not indicative of future performance** (except when one takes advantage of specific aspects of momentum investing, again to be discussed in a later post), I would not recommend using financial performance metrics to guide purchases (especially in highly volatile markets), but they do give you a snapshot of the company’s current financial environment. 

Above I’m suggesting that generic suboxone will likely provide a value to the company overtime, as suboxone gains prominence in treatment of ODD. However, what else is NVS up to? 

COVID 19

No covid 19 therapeutics, however Novartis is assisting Pfizer and CureVac in production capacity. Specifically, they will be assisting in filling the vials. I don’t think this will contribute much financially, but it’s good PR, and lets face it good for human kind. 

Current Pharmaceuticals

Novartis is one of the largest pharma companies in the world, so I’m not going to go into an exhaustive list of their products. You can find them on the wikipedia page here: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals)

However, many of their drugs have good staying power. Of note, they make Entresto, an Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibitor. For my renal nerds out there take a look at the mechanism, really awesome stuff.. There was a lot of buzz in the medical community about Entresto a few years back. This NEJM trial was huge, showing that the Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibition was superior to Enalapril in reducing risks of death and hospitalization. For those of you who aren’t familiar, Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor medication which has become a mainstay in the treatment of heart failure.

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077)

Digital Health

Novartis recently partnered with Science 37, who has developed an interesting system for virtual clinical trials. COVID 19 was a catalyst for digital health, and I think companies that provide telehealth platforms are going to continue to grow. Many patients love the telehealth option, and often opt for it over an in-person visit for many smaller medical issues/checkups. 

Clinical Trials 

As a large pharmaceutical company, Novartis has a well established clinical pipeline for research. I find that betting on the “next big thing” or breakthrough in therapy is typically a losing bet, especially because you have no idea what the results will be as molecular therapies and typical pharmaceuticals go through the rigorous phases of clinical trials. It is a better to bet on a company that has a lot of experience bringing products to market, with a large research pool to pull from. This article has a great table demonstrating the “success rates” of various drug classes coming to market: 

[https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:\~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate](https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate).

(Spoiler: It’s not good) 

Overall, NVS has demonstrated steady growth, and is a huge pharmaceutical manufacturer. They have a large pool of research and will be responsible for the generic version of Suboxone, which I believe will have a strong role in treatment of ODD moving forward in the opiate crisis. The technicals on NVS are pretty middle of the road, with a reassuring P/E ratio and a dead center RSI. I think it would be a good value investment in the long term, but short term gains may be difficult.

# C. March Investor Presentation

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816696/000121390021016441/ea137987ex99-1\_industrial.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816696/000121390021016441/ea137987ex99-1_industrial.htm)

\-A soon to be named auto company is entering a deal with Arbe that will result in 300 million in sales for one model, and could account for 10x (3 billion) in sales for more models.

\-The auto company is likely a US company because it is described as “Western” while the OEM described next to this mystery Western company in the presentation is described as “European”(If it’s a Western and not European, it’s likely a US company) *(\*See investor presentation slide 22)*

\-Elon Musk is quoted in the Arbe investor presentation - “Lidar is doomed” (\*Agree or disagree with Musk feeling this way today, the company is making a point in their presentation about the value of their \~$100 radar on chip IP outperforming the Lidar tech that can costs $1,000’s)

\-Arbe is a “First Mover” and “Market Leader” in 4D imaging radar technology-(Slide 16). This positions them to be chosen first to take the place of traditional radars in the exact same slot that is already built in for radar use, but can now be used for 4D imaging radar chips.

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# What new customer/company fits the description of the largest new deal?

**Customer description #1 -** It is “One of the largest automobile companies in the **world”** *(\*See the Arbe CEO’s merger webcast))*

**Customer description #2 -** It is a “Leading, Global, Western” company\*-(presumably not with a homebase in Europe for reasons described above\*\*\*)\*\* *(\*See Investor presentation slide 22)*

**Company that meets both descriptions** **=** One of the US’s “Big Three” -- **General Motors $GM, Ford $F, or Chrysler/Stellantis $STLA** *\*Although there are no guarantees that it will be one of these 3, there are not many other companies that fit both above descriptions given by Arbe*

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Who is Arbe Robotics / $ITAC and what do they do?

\-$ITAC recently merged with Arbe Robotics to create a publicly traded company

\-Their product is the first and only available long-range, 4D Imaging Radar (so little to no competition)

\-Their 4D Imaging Radar:

\&gt;Is used in personal cars, trucking, delivery, industry, agriculture, mining, etc. \*(Primary / most profitable focus is the automotive industry)

\&gt;Is needed for every level of vehicle autonomy (Tier 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

\&gt;Supposedly outperforms Lidar and Cameras, especially in fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and other poor conditions (see performance details below)

\&gt;Fits in the same slot that current, old radars fit in, but their radar provides over 100x better quality, and a 4th dimension, allowing you to “see” objects in a new way

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Is Arbe’s technology a “disruptor” with a large market opportunity?

1. Qamcom’s CEO explains why Arbe’s technology is a disruptor that supersedes existing alternatives - “Choosing Arbe as a partner was an obvious choice since there is no other radar chipset solution on the market that is comparative,” said Johan Lassing, chief executive officer of Qamcom. “Traditional or contemporary radar solutions don’t solve the challenges that autonomous vehicles face. Arbe revolutionized radar by creating a sensor that provides a never-before-seen image which is close to the image that vision based sensors achieve that also has the properties of radar – Arbe’s 4D Imaging Radar Solution has the potential to be the primary sensor candidate for the sensor suite of any autonomous and semi-autonomous applications and next generation perception platforms.”
2. The CEO says their new 4D Visual Radar technology is designed to fit in the same spot as existing radars, making it immediately usable by auto companies[ ](https://podcasts.apple.com/il/podcast/173-noam-arkind-arbe-robotics/id1353975287?i=1000501753796)
3. The 4D Imaging Radar is suitable for every level of vehicle autonomy (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
4. Already has “key partnerships” with Nvidia, Valeo, Denso, and other reputable/large companies involving their radar-on-chip technology (\*See slide 9 of investor presentation)
5. The technology can be used outside of cars - e.g. mines, agriculture, trucking, delivery, more -[ ](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/11/qamcom-will-bring-arbes-4d-imaging-radar-to-trucks-mines-and-farms/)
6. CEO claims their main competitor is Mobileye (\*Mobileye was bought out by Intel for $15 million). CEO claims Mobileye will have a chipset in 2025 that is similar to what Arbe already has today (\*See investor webcast link below)
7. Resolution and performance supersedes all existing radar technology[ ](https://www.embedded.com/imaging-radar-development-platform-offers-2k-resolution/)
8. The Arbe CEO explains their IP value “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""

# Valuation/Profitability considerations

\-Arbe CEO said “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""[ https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/qamcom-arbe-collaborate-bring-power-150000097.html?soc\_src=social-sh&amp;soc\_trk=tw&amp;tsrc=twtr&amp;\_\_twitter\_impression=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/qamcom-arbe-collaborate-bring-power-150000097.html?soc_src=social-sh&amp;soc_trk=tw&amp;tsrc=twtr&amp;__twitter_impression=true)

\-The Arbe CEO says ""When Mobileye passed $300 million in revenue, the figure that we are expecting for 2025, Intel bought them for $15 billion.”

\-The Spac transaction values Arbe at a low $572 million enterprise value, implying only a 1.8x multiple on 2025 forecasted revenue and a 4.4x multiple on 2025 forecasted pro forma Adjusted EBITDA \*This presumably does not account for new or unexpected deals that may arise of the 10 auto companies they are currently in final stage talks with, or the company referred to as “one of the largest auto companies in the world”

\-ITAC/Arbe has a small, 7.7 million share public float which could move quickly when catalysts are revealed (\*Institutional elements of the non-public float include a PIPE paid for by respected “strong hand” institutional investors such as M&amp;G Investment Management, Varana Capital, Texas Ventures, and Eyal Waldman-(founder and CEO of Mellanox Technologies $MLNX))

\-The institutional portion of the float is unlikely to sell - “What matters is not the price or the valuation at the time of the flotation, but in the long term; especially when the **holdings of all the existing shareholders are vested for at least a year**, so you don't sell in a hurry“[ ](https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-israel-has-more-unicorns-than-all-of-europe-1001366171)

\-The CEO recently recommended that shareholders hold shares until they reach a $15 billion dollar market cap-(This is his 3rd company and he believes this company will reach that)(\*This source is described as “Israel's largest and most popular news and content website”) -[ ](https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5907598,00.html)

# Summary

Arbe developed and patented a new type of 4D radar imaging technology that negates the need for expensive lidar and vastly improves existing camera/radar performance (over 100x better than existing radar). Arbe is the “first mover” in the market, with little to no competition. The new 4D imaging radar fits in the same slot in a car that the older radar technology uses, making the transition easy for auto companies. The total market for the product includes all Tiers of vehicles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

The price was designed to be virtually the same as existing radars-($100 per unit, $150 for premium), and is drastically more affordable than paying $1,000’s for lidar. Arbe’s 4D radar vastly outperforms the more expensive Lidar in many conditions such as fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and more, making it indispensable for both ADAS and autonomous applications.

\*Value will be confirmed by catalyst/deals soon, as the CEO has many quotes describing deals they are signing to be publicized shortly (see above).

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations.

**Let's cover the basics**
---

Nano X Imaging (NNOX) is an x-ray machines design company. They are currently purely an R&amp;D company with hopes of producing the NANOX.ARC x-ray machine, a low-cost solution for standard x-rays. They have already presented working prototypes of this machine.

**Another x-ray machine? So what....**

The main innovation in NNOX is the cost of their x-ray machine. By utilizing a technology called cold-cathode, they are able to drastically reduce the cost of the most expensive pieces of standard x-ray equipment (for digital x-rays). Thus, they hope to compete in this space with a price advantage, manufacturing their solution at $10,000 ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/06/why-is-nano-x-imaging-stock-soaring/)).

**What does it mean to compete in this space?**

The global market for x-ray machines is $13.1B and expected to grow to $20B by 2027 ([source](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/medical-x-ray-market)). Most of this growth is expected to be captured by hospitals and diagnostic centers as x-rays expand its role in the medical field:

https://imgur.com/lEB50J7

Currently, the average digital x-ray machine runs at ~$150K ([source](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/purchasing-insight-portable-x-ray#:~:text=Hospitals%20with%20an%20existing%20analog,and%20type%20of%20detector%20selected.)). Because NNOX x-ray machines don't bring anything new to the table, the only value it provides will be how cheaply it can depress its prices. Its current business model is to lose money on the x-ray machine (selling it for under $10K) but make that money back in a subscription model ($40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX) ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)).

**Basically, they are trying to be the Gillette of x-ray machines. Sell their product at a loss, but make it all up with subscription revenue.**

---

**NNOX has exciting sales claims, but are they real?**
---

NNOX claims that they are pricing a $2M machine for $10K. This is mostly a lie as modern day digital x-ray machines run at $150K, not $2M. So, if this is a lie, what else is?

**Who the hell even wants cheaper NNOX machines?**

First of all, let's see if NNOX makes sense for hospitals. We're going to calculate how many x-rays the hospital should give per day in order to recoup the cost of purchasing a new x-ray machine versus using NNOX's x-ray machine. Hold on tight because we're about to do some... *simple math*.

(150,000 - 10,000) / 40 = 3500 x-rays total

3,500 / 365 = ~10 x-rays per day.

Thus, for a single year, a hospital must use their new x-ray machine 10 times per day at least for this to be a cost effective solution. Given that x-ray machines usually have a lifecycle of 4-6 years, this number is further reduced.

3,500 / 365 / 4 = ~2.5 x-rays per day.

So, if a hospital does at least 3 x-rays per day, they would rather use their own x-ray machine rather than NNOX. So, wtf? According to NNOX, the low estimate of a hospitals usage of x-ray machines is 7 per day while its high estimate is 20 ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)). Already, this financial decision doesn't make any sense. So, why would anyone buy a NNOX x-ray machine?

Simply put, we're not considering all the costs. Within NNOX's subscription model, it includes the software to manage the x-rays as well as maintenance and installation of the machines. With a standard  x-ray machine, you'll be paying for installation, maintenance, and software which more than doubles the price of the x-ray machine. That combined with the fact that businesses don't like their cash sunk into high-cost assets (depreciation is a b*****) and suddenly, you have a legitimate business case to use NNOX x-ray machines over the current day standard.

**What kind of sales is NNOX expecting?**

NNOX is hoping to deploy 15,000 units by 2024 ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/11/09/nano-x-imaging-ltd-nnox-q3-2020-earnings-call-tran/)). To that end, they already have ~10,000 machines in pre-deployment stages. 5000 machines are contingent on approval in 9 countries. Another 5000 is under negotiation in US, Korea, and Vietnam.

Wow, they are already 2/3 of the way to their 2024 sales goals!

Not quite so fast. Pre-deployment is the same as pre-orders. They are non-binding expressions of interest by companies. While some of these pre-orders will certainly fall flat, I do expect many of them to pull through as well. There are some very legitimate businesses who have signed up for NNOX x-ray machines:

- SPI: one of Mexico's top Pharma companies

- USA-RAD: a company 25% owned by Siemens Healthineers (a $18B in sales US company)

- Golden Vine: a Taiwan company owned by one of the most influential business families in Taiwan (Liao)

Also, please note that while NNOX's end user is hospitals and diagnostic centers, their primary *customer* is not. Their business model utilizes already established supply chains with many hospital contacts to purchase their machines in bulk before reselling to hospitals. This is the same strategy that fleet vehicle sales employs.

There are a number of other pre-order customers as well, but it mostly follows the same logic. A lot of their current pre-orders are from legitimate businesses which I believe are serious about following through with the order if NNOX's product can deliver.

**Beyond their sales, they have key partners to bolster their legitimacy**

Take a look at some of their strategic partners. You will instantly recognize some of the names:

https://imgur.com/qAu58ut

The biggest names on this list is probably:

- SK Telecom: South Korea's big 4 telecommunications company. They have their hands in near everything. Think Google of South Korea.

- Foxconn: Everybody knows the infamous Foxconn. While I can't vouch for the health of their factory workers, they are damn good at manufacturing and can easily scale any product (usually at the cost of the health of their workers).

**However, there is some controversy around their claims**

There have been various short reports claiming that NNOX is a fraud. Both Muddy Waters ([source](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/nnox/mw-is-short-nnox/)) and Citron Research ([source](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NANO-X-a-Complete-Farce-on-the-Market.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1G6CGHXVYZbIZ8JOHF_WSf086xY3guvTKBYaFwlmSnu-XJSv9zLrgJm-I)) released scathing reports, concluding that the true price of NNOX is $2 and $0. That's right $0. However, since the reports have come out, various other people have widely disputed the short reports' claims. DKA, a consortium of global technology companies, for example, wrote a counter short report ([source](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging)) and there has been much backlash in other financial communities like Motley Fool ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/27/why-are-people-shorting-nano-x/)).

The arguments are as follows:

- Shorters believe that NNOX is too good a story to be true. They invested ~$8M to produce NNOX.ARC and they're going to disrupt a $20B industry? Ridiculous. Furthermore, some of their pre-order customers are sketchy and may not be legitimate. Lastly, there (at the time) was no proof that NNOX's product worked at all.

- Counter-argument claims that low investment is not a barrier for impossibility. They also went through NNOX's customer pre-orders and proved that many of them were, in fact, legitimate. Lastly, NNOX personally went to a radiology conference to prove that their prototype worked.

Personally, I think that the short reports have been proven wrong and the market seems to agree as well.

---

**Okay, /u/jraywang, I didn't read any of this, just tell me if NNOX is fairly valued or not!**
---

Calm your tits, internet person. We're getting to that.

NNOX has a current valuation of $2B. The industry they play in is worth $20B per year. Though there are tertiary services and business models, we'll stick with these 2 numbers for now. The multiple for earnings in this sector are as follows ([source](https://www.gurufocus.com/industry_overview.php?sector=Healthcare&amp;region=USA)):

- Healthcare: 26

- Healthcare Devices: 53

Therefore, in order for NNOX to have a fair valuation currently, their **earnings** should be between $40M and $75M, which is entirely possible within a $20B industry. There's no information regarding their profit margins, so let's just assume they have a 25% profit margin (I literally made this number up. If someone can find a suitable replacement, you should use it).

Going to some of the agreements already negotiated, Promedica Bioeletronics has agreed to pay $13.5M per year for 500 NNOX machines. Extrapolating this out, every 1000 in per unit sales should provide NNOX $26M in revenues and $6.5M in profits. Now, given that we believe 15,000 unit sales is realistic given their current conditions, this would equate to $100M in annual revenues! This is much higher than the $40M expected if they were judged as a healthcare device company and the $75M expected if they were to be judged as a healthcare company. Therefore...

**Best case scenario, we see 150% upside. Worse case scenario, we see 33% upside.**

However, this is IF they can achieve their 15,000 of target sales.

**But can their balance sheet survive until they reach their sales targets?**

Short answer: yes. NNOX has a great balance sheet ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNOX/balance-sheet/)). With $240M in cash and no immediate debts, I see no reason for them to dilute their shares for financing. Their operating cash flow is currently at -$6M which means they can operate under their current balance sheet for 40 years. This is insane.

---

**In conclusion...**
---

**NNOX is a bull case**. They have an extremely healthy balance sheet with minimal loss in cash flow. Moreover, their initial sales estimates look realistic and their revenues look promising. They have multiple strategic partners that are both legitimate, powerful, and influential. Their current valuation seems to still be suffering from short reports that are most likely flawed.

Jamie Dimon said he’s optimistic the pandemic will end with a U.S. economic rebound that could last at least two years.

“I  have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge  deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a  successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S.  economy will likely boom,” the [JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US) chief executive officer said Wednesday in his [annual letter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QR6VNCMEQTXC) to shareholders. “This boom could easily run into 2023.”

Unprecedented federal rescue programs have blunted  unemployment and averted further economic deterioration, according to  Dimon, who said banks entered the crisis strong and able to help  communities weather the storm. While lenders also benefited from U.S.  stimulus, they built up buffers against future loan losses and performed  well in stress tests, he said.

Dimon also pointed to U.S. consumers, who used stimulus  checks to reduce debt to the lowest level in 40 years and stashed them  in savings, giving them -- like corporations -- an “extraordinary”  amount of spending power once lockdowns end. The latest round of  quantitative easing measures will have created more than $3 trillion in  deposits at U.S. banks, a portion of which can be lent out, he said.

It could all add up to  a Goldilocks moment, according to Dimon, where growth is fast and  sustained while inflation ticks up gently. Threats to that outcome  include virus variants and a rapid or sustained jump in inflation that  prompts rates to rise sooner.

At 65, Dimon is the most prominent executive in global  banking, serving as a spokesman for the industry while leading a titan  of both Wall Street and consumer lending. He’s run the company since the  end of 2005, and is the only CEO still at the helm after steering a  major bank through the financial crisis.

The 65-page letter (plus a  page of footnotes) is Dimon’s longest yet, following last year’s  abbreviated one that came less than a week after he returned to work  from emergency heart surgery. As always, it is wide-ranging, touching on  topics from financial regulation to China to inequality and  institutional racism.

### Competitive Threats

Dimon,  who built the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank in history, also  warned shareholders that his industry’s disruption by technology is  finally at hand. Shadow lenders are gaining ground. Traditional banks  are being consigned to a shrinking role in the financial system.

“Banks have enormous competitive threats -- from virtually every angle,” he said. “Fintech and Big Tech are here… big time!”

[Read more: Why Fintech Battles Ahead Are About More Than Banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/why-fintech-battles-ahead-are-about-more-than-banks-quicktake)

The  letter expands on predictions Dimon has offered for years, this time  declaring many of those threats have now arrived. Financial-technology  firms are more formidable, offering easy-to-use, fast and smart  products, he said. Shadow banks -- a group that includes investment  funds and online platforms offering financing to companies and consumers  -- are winning market share too.

Those groups have outpaced the  growth of banks by some measures, often thanks to less regulation. They  have also done “a terrific job in easing customers’ pain points” with  slick online platforms, he said.

“While I am still confident that  JPMorgan Chase can grow and earn a good return for its shareholders, the  competition will be intense, and we must get faster and be more  creative,” the CEO wrote. “Acquisitions are in our future, and fintech  is an area where some of that cash could be put to work.”

As  with previous annual letters, Dimon touched on geopolitical issues. On  Brexit, he said that uncertain financial regulations coupled with  political pressure may lead to a “tipping point many years out when it  may make sense to move all functions that service Europe out of the United Kingdom and into continental Europe.”

Dimon  mentioned China more than 30 times throughout the letter, predicting it  will probably overtake the U.S. in the next 20 years as the biggest  economy and financial market. He lauded China’s growth over the last 40  years but said the country will have to confront serious issues in the  next 40, including pollution, corruption and inefficiency.

“China does not have a straight road to becoming the dominant economic power,” Dimon said. “For the near term, if China and the United States  can maintain a healthy strategic and economic relationship, it could  greatly benefit both countries – as well as the rest of the world.”

He  also touched on the bank’s future need for real estate, expecting it to  drop significantly as remote working outlasts the pandemic. The bank  could require some 60 seats for every 100 employees as some staff work  under a hybrid model, he said. The lender still intends to build its new  headquarters in New York City, he added.

Despite a warning just two days ago from Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell that corporate leaders should refrain from taking stances on  divisive political issues, Dimon waded into areas including immigration,  health care and education.

“Our problems are neither Democratic  nor Republican -- nor are the solutions,” Dimon wrote. “Unfortunately,  however, partisan politics is preventing collaborative policy from being  designed and implemented, particularly at the federal level.”

### ‘Terribly Wrong’

For all the brightness in his economic outlook, Dimon found cause for far darker laments.

The  pandemic has thrust profound inequities and their devastating effects  into the spotlight. On issues such as health care and immigration,  people have lost faith in the government’s ability to solve problems, he  said.

“Americans know that something has gone terribly wrong, and  they blame this country’s leadership: the elite, the powerful, the  decision makers -- in government, in business and in civic society,” he  wrote. “This is completely appropriate, for who else should take the  blame?”

That fuels populism on the right and left, he said. “But  populism is not policy, and we cannot let it drive another round of poor  planning and bad leadership that will simply make our country’s  situation worse.”

The CEO even put it in economic terms: He estimates  wide-ranging “dysfunction” has cut a percentage point off the U.S.  growth rate. He suggested studying solutions abroad, pointing to  apprenticeship programs in Germany, health care in Singapore and  infrastructure in Hong Kong.

Dimon also reiterated a call for a  national Marshall Plan, referring to the U.S. effort to help Western  Europe recover from World War II, to address the structural challenges  behind the country’s racial and economic crises.

“Fixing America’s  problems is going to take hard work. But if we divide them into their  component parts, we will find many viable solutions,” he said. “With  thoughtful analysis, common sense and pragmatism, there is hope.”"|investing|JPMorgan’s Dimon Says ‘This Boom Could Easily Run Into 2023’ - Jamie is the MAN!|126.0|0.81

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, it is a buy and hold strategy where 3x leveraged S&amp;P 500 UPRO and 3x leveraged 20-year bonds TMF are held 55 to 45 percent, but if we use options to hedge, you could change this allocation to favor UPRO more than TMF (70/30, 75/25, or even 100 UPRO)

&amp;nbsp;

Right off the bat, there's a few concerns with this strategy. First, it is very volatile and depends on the SPY continuing to move steadily up. Many folks are speculating we're in a bubble that is bound to burst somewhat soon. 

&amp;nbsp;

By far the biggest issue with this strategy is that a large drawdown in SPY could absolutely tank UPRO given that it is 3x leveraged. Last March, the fund went from ~$80 to ~$20 in just a couple of weeks, and only reached $80 again in January of this year.

&amp;nbsp;

The inherent hedge of this strategy is in TMF as bonds are often negatively correlated to equities. During the same crash last year, TMF shot up from ~$31 to ~$47, and stayed above $40 for a good portion of the year.

&amp;nbsp;

However, bonds increasing when the SPY decreases isn't a guarantee, so why wouldn't we hedge further by buying some puts on UPRO and TMF ~10% OTM dated a year or so out? This is particularly compelling with Volatility at a low-point at the moment. Puts at this price range for this far out would cost quite a bit, roughly 10% of total investment, but would limit max loss in the event of a major downturn to cost of puts + how far OTM the puts are (20% total).

&amp;nbsp;

Should such a downturn occur, there's a couple things that could happen:

1) UPRO crashes, TMF goes up: in this case the gains from TMF will partially offset the losses in UPRO and you could exercise your put on UPRO and reinvest back in when the market starts to recover.

2) UPRO and TMF both crash: In this case you could exercise the puts and reinvest during the recovery. In the worst case scenario that the market doesn't recover (bear market) you would exercise your puts  and realize a 20% loss from initial investment.

&amp;nbsp;

Given the potential returns of UPRO, it seems likely that it would be capable of generating some impressive returns, particularly if stock market is able to continue the bull-party for the rest of the year. Given the optimism around re-opening and the Fed's dovish monetary policy, this is a definite possibility. And if the market really does break? You could certainly do worse than 20% loss.

I'm sure I'm missing something about this, so before committing to this plan I was hoping to get some opinions. 

Thanks!

EDIT: The major concern I think with this, is the high cost of buying the puts. You would need for UPRO to gain 10% to break even on the puts within the next 288 days (for a Jan 21, 2022 expiration). Of course, this could possibly be mitigated a bit by selling covered calls on UPRO."|investing|Hedging the Hedgefundie (UPRO &amp; TMF)|8.0|0.62

However, I would argue even if the numbers are 10% instead of 12.9%, 17% instead of 20.4% and 6% instead of 7.5% that you would want to jump into this industry as it is going to grow at a much faster rate than the rest of the market.

&amp;#x200B;

Now a little background on [Turtle Beach](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

Turtle Beach was originally founded in the 1970s and their main goal was making sound software/hardware for musicians. In 2005, however, they decided to use their experience in engineering sound to create headsets for gamers and that has been what they have focused on since.  If you want more info on their history you can go [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Beach_Corporation)

&amp;#x200B;

Now Turtle beach is  known for their gaming headsets - they have nearly half the market share in gaming headsets per their last earnings call [You can see the earnings call transcript here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4411642-turtle-beach-corporation-hear-ceo-juergen-stark-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) in addition to this, however, they also own [Roccat](https://en.roccat.org/) and [Neat Microphones](https://www.neatmic.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

So now that we have a little background on Turtle beach, I will give you the reasons that I think they are set up perfectly to capture this growing market and to grow in the years to come.

&amp;#x200B;

The Financials:

[Yahoo finance financials for HEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HEAR/financials/)

&amp;#x200B;

2 things really stick out for me for Turtle beach when you compare them to the other companies in the industry: 1. their balance sheet and 2. their cost of revenue

If you look at the balance sheet you will see the have an objectively great balance sheet.  $167 in Current assets  - $47 million of which is Cash on hand and $78 Million in Current liabilities - almost all of which is short term payable and accrued expenses. The bottom line is **the company has $47 million in cash and $0 in debt**.  They also have a great gross profit - coming in at about 37% of revenue. which when compared to companies in their industry like Corsair who has a 27% gross profit %.

&amp;#x200B;

Now is where I think people really miss out on Turtle Beach, everyone thinks they are still just a headset company, primarily for consoles - obviously their ticker  doesn't help this image, but they are expanding their foothold into the Computer parts and microphones aggressively.  Per the last earnings call: "" We will continue to expand our PC  gaming portfolio of headsets, keyboards, and mice. The additional  ROCCAT PC products we launched in the fall last year will be followed by  another wave of really exciting new PC gaming products this year. As  I've mentioned, our near-term goal is to create an incremental $100  million business in PC accessories and our longer-term goal is to lead  those PC gaming categories."" How do we know this is really what they are doing and not just simply something said to make investors happy? well if you go to Turtle Beach's website and look at the [Careers Page](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/careers/) you will see that one of the jobs is director of brand marketing - Roccat. This along with the news today that [Roccat just snagged a deal with LCS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/turtle-beachs-roccat-pc-brand-123000929.html) tells me they will continue to grow this brand.

In addition to this Turtle beach is still being valued as a gaming headset company.  Look at their PE ratio - it's only 12.19 as of closing today.  Compare that to other players in the sector - Corsair at roughly 27, Logitech at roughly 20 and razer who doesn't turn a profit last I checked.  A PE of 12 for a company with no debt in an industry that will continue to grow is an amazing prospect - however their current valuation makes sense if you think they are simply making headsets which will have moderate growth in the years to come verses PC accessories.

I do want to mention some quick risks to Turtle beach as I think there are some which could very much derail the company:

1. My whole case for Turtle beach depends on them growing Roccat and Neat Microphone - either of these could fail and if that is the case they will have trouble growing at a good pace - compare this to the branding that Corsair, logitech, and Razer already have, and you have a company that should be trading at a lower PE ratio
2. Similar to above, they are a very concentrated company and the majority of their sales do come from headsets, that industry will not grow at an alarmingly fast rate, so that will stifle their growth if it cannot be addressed.
3. While the amount of cash they have for their company size is incredibly good, it is not an amazing amount of cash compared to companies like Logitech, who , if I did my math correctly, [has 1.3 Billion in cash on hand, enough to buyout Turtle Beach at their current market value](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/balance-sheet?p=LOGI).
4. Following the above, In this industry moats are hard to find, while this is a good thing for the growth of Roccat, it is a dangerous thing for the Turtle Beach headsets
5. Finally, due to the company size, one or two poor moves could really derail the company, so that is something to keep in mind.

Overall I am very bullish on the company, this is not my most in depth DD (time has been tight to do a good write up), but I think I brought up most of my bull points.

Positions: Currently 46 @ an Average cost of 25.57.  I will continue to add more shares though throughout the year as I believe this company is undervalued and in a great position to grow.

As some of these stocks get near their all time highs again, I've been cutting down my exposure to some of them because some of them had grown to a large % of my portfolio (a good problem to have). As a result, I've built up some cash and have been looking for cheaper names of beaten down companies outside of technology. One name I came across was Atlas Air, ticker symbol: AAWW. 

\*Not a financial advisor nor is this intended to be an investment recommendation. Just my two cents about a company I found. Everyone should always do their own DD and reach their own conclusions. 

**Company Profile:**

The company operates aircrafts that it leases to a variety of customers. The business is divided up into two main categories: 

ACMI - the company leases out planes to customers either for chartering pasengers or shipping goods. The customer is responsible for expenses like fuel, landing, and other risks. AAWW is responsible for providing the plane, crew, maintenance, and insurance. 

Charter - this segment provides chartered planes to a variety of customers including sports teams, the US military, freight operators, etc. Here, the customer pays AAWW a fixed fee in order to charter passenger or cargo planes. 

**2020 Financial Highlights:**

\-Revenue grew 17% up to $3.2B  
\-Net Income grew to $360M  
\-2020 Gross Margin expanded to 34% from 30% in 2019  
\-Current Assets grew significantly to $1.2B, $845.6M of it in cash  
\-Net Debt decreased from $2.9B in 4Q 2019 to $2.02B in 4Q 2020, leverage ratio dropped from 4.4 in 2019 to 2.1 in 2020.   
\-Over $1B in cash from operations in FY 2020

**Thesis**

The company did not provide guidance for FY 2021, something that doesnt bother me. The pandemic is still pressing and likely will be for most of 2021. I wouldnt put much stock into any 2021 guidance given anyway. 

I really like this name because of its insanely low valuation and due to the continued need for freight operators. Shipping has obviously been tough due to the pandemic and shipping via ocean is challenging due to the high cost and delayed timing. There is a massive shortage of shipping containers and many shippers are looking for alternative sources to get goods shipped. I think a company like Atlas Air could benefit from that in 2021. Even as the pandemic starts to dwindle down (hopefully), there will still be a huge need for shipping and logistics. sure, people will go out and travel, eat in person, etc... but they will still order online and goods will be in high demand. 

The valuation of the company is insanely low right now. But how can a stock go from $23 to $61 in a year and still be highly undervalued? Right now, the company is trading at a Price/Book of .78 and a price/cash flow of 1.83. Notmany high quality names are going to give you those valuations. 

One other thing I like about this name is their cash build up and deleveraging. This company only had about $100M cash on hand as of 12/31/2020 and like most companies, it cut expenses and capex when the pandemic struck due to the desire to keep cash. Well now they are in a great position to use that excess cash to create value for their shareholders. Management did not make any predications about large stock buybacks, dividends, or acquisitions. I think stock buybacks, something I usually oppose, is the right answer here. The stock is trading under book value and it would make sense to buyback stock here. I dont know the industry well enough to know what names could serve as a strategic acquisition for them. 

**Ownership**

One other interesting note is that Amazon is a shareholder, owning less than 5% of the company. Amazon has warrants that it has excercised in the past. Based on what I can see, Amazon could own more than 10% of the company and appoint a Board member, but it has kept its ownership stake under 5%. As of 12/31/2020, AAWW has 27 airplanes leased to Amazon. 

Of the top 5 institutional holdings, 4 have increased their stakes in AAWW (BlackRock, Vanguard, Greenlight Capital, and Donald Smith &amp; Company.)

**Risks**

\-While I think the Amazon deal is a net positive, there is a risk that Amazon could terminate the agreement. Amazon has the right to terminate the agremeent with or without cause with a 180 day notice. Additionally, if Amazon continues to acquire shares through their warrants, it would dilute existing shareholders. 

\-Air Atlas also does a lot of business with the Department of Defense, Air Mobility Command (AMC). Revenue from AMC represented 24% of total revenue in 2019 and 16% in 2020. While the lowering reliance on them is good, 16% is still a large number. Air Atlas and AMC operate in 2 year contracts and requires strong operational performance from AAWW. Changes to their relationship with AMC could harm the company. 

\-Climate change - if steps are taken to curb carbon footprints through additional regulations or taxes, that would be a net negative for AAWW

\-Decrease in air freight. I noted this one earlier, but the risk that air transportation demand decreases is a realistic risk. I dont agree with that and think the problems with shipping via oceans could lead to more business for air freight companies. 

**Final Thoughts:**

This is my first DD post on this form, so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts (good and bad). 

I like this company and continue to read about it. It is cheap and there are certainly reasons for that, but I think the stock is still undervalued. The main premise of this position is: ""Do you trust management to allocate capital correctly here given their large cash balance."" For me, the answer is yes, but I am mindful of existing relationships that company has with the DoD and Amazon. I have seen plenty of smaller companies get crushed due to existing agreements with larger companies.

They’ve benefited in a positive way from the PPP business loans, most of which won’t be paid down early as companies seek flexibility. They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. They’re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours. I love small businesses where people wear multiple hats, and this place must have hired at least *one* guy who likes to work.

Edit: 
1. Thank you for the guy researching the temperory impact of the PPP loan and placing it around 100 Mil in loan growth through the program, referencing that most growth has been non PPP in 2020. This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere. 

2. Someone brought up an acquisition potentially capping the value of the stock. Funny thing with that is that there are two “Landmark” banks, this one and one on the east coast. On LARK’s investor relations page they have a highlight talking about the investor confusion and how they’re not related/not affected by the acquisition.

(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) is exploring a sale of its Advanced Elastomer Systems (AES (NYSE:AES)) division, potentially valuing the elastic polymer maker at around $800 million including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.

The deal would allow the oil major to nibble at its debt pile, which totaled $45.5 billion at the end of December. Its shares are up around 37% year-to-date on investor expectations that the company will benefit from a recovery in energy prices.

Exxon has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) to solicit interest in AES from potential buyers, including private equity firms, the sources said.

The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Exxon incurred a historic loss of $22.4 billion last year. It is trying to convince a skeptical Wall Street that it can rebound after years of overspending left it deeply indebted and lagging rivals better geared for a world demanding cleaner fuels.

AES is known for its Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), which are elastic polymers used in automotive, industrial and consumer products. The business was launched in 1991 as a limited partnership between ExxonMobil Chemical and Solutia. Exxon became the sole owner of AES in 2002.

The global TPV market is seen growing from $1.6 billion in 2019 and to $2.6 billion in 2027, though the industry has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to factory shutdowns and supply chain issues, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com."|investing|Exxon explores sale of elastic polymer business: sources|62.0|0.87

[Threats from every angle](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#banks-enormous)

&gt;1. Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.

&gt;In the chart below, you will see that U.S. banks (and European banks) have become much smaller in size relative to multiple measures, ranging from shadow banks to fintech competitors and to markets in general.

&gt;Whether you look at the chart above over 10 or 20 years, U.S. banks have become much smaller relative to U.S. financial markets and to the size of most of the shadow banks. You can also see the rapid growth of payment and fintech companies and the extraordinary size of Big Tech companies. (As an aside, capital and global systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI) capital rules were supposed to reflect the economy’s increased size and banks’ reduced size within the economy. This simply has not happened in the United States.)

&gt;Some regulators will look at the chart above and point out that risk has been moved out of the banking system, which they wanted and which clearly makes banks safer. That may be true, but there is a flip side – banks are reliable, less-costly and consistent credit providers throughout good times and in bad times, whereas many of the credit providers listed in the chart above are not. More important, transactions made by well-controlled, well-supervised and well-capitalized banks may be less risky to the system than those transactions that are pushed into the shadows.

&gt;2. The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulation.

&gt;The chart below shows the potential regulatory differences between being a bank and being a nonbank or a fintech company – though this varies for each type of company on each item depending upon its legal and regulatory status. In some cases, these regulatory differences may be completely appropriate, but certainly not in all cases.

&gt;When I make a list like this, I know I will be accused of complaining about bank regulations. But I am simply laying out the facts for our shareholders in trying to assess the competitive landscape going forward.

&gt;It is completely clear that, increasingly, many banking products, such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others, are moving out of the banking system. In addition, lending in many forms – including mortgage, student, leveraged, consumer and non-credit card consumer – is moving out of the banking system. Neobanks and nonbanks are gaining share in consumer accounts, which effectively hold cash-like deposits. Payments are also moving out of the banking system, in merchant processing and in debit or alternative payment systems.

[Covid-19 and the economy](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#covid-19)

&gt;1. Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic.

&gt;The Federal Reserve (critically, with the support of the U.S. Treasury) immediately rolled out facilities that financed Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other securities that effectively reversed the financial panic taking place. A full-blown financial crisis would have made the COVID-19 recession far worse, deeper and longer. Markets reacted extremely positively, and companies, over the next nine months, raised an unprecedented $2 trillion in debt and equity at good prices, dramatically improving their financial condition and balance sheets.

&gt;Congress, importantly, also took immediate action to provide fiscal stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, totaling $2.2 trillion. This largely consisted of stimulus payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment insurance and loans, which could be forgiven, to small businesses. Please see the following sidebar for more detail on the Paycheck Protection Program.

&gt;Suffice it to say while real damage was done, the size and scope of these programs dramatically reversed the deterioration of the economy and unemployment, which hit 14.8% in April 2020 but made steady progress back to 6.7% by the end of the year – though this number underrepresents the damage that was done because of the large deterioration in labor force participation and the potential permanent loss of many small businesses.

[Public Policy. American Exceptionalism, Competitiveness and Leadership: Challenged by China, COVID-19 and Our Own Competence](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#public-policy)

&gt;Our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and strain from various events: the COVID-19 pandemic, of course, which has taken more American lives than the total lost in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined, resulting in acute economic distress for millions more; the brutal murder of George Floyd and the racial unrest that followed; the divisive 2020 presidential election, culminating in the storming of the Capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democracy; and the seemingly inevitable, but nonetheless alarming and unnerving, rise of China, threatening America’s global preeminence.

&gt;America has faced tough times before – the Civil War, World War I, the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed, and World War II, among others. As recently as the late 1960s and 1970s, we struggled with the loss of the Vietnam War, political and racial injustice, recessions, inflation and the emergence of Japan as an economic power. But in each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors. This time may be different.

&gt;China’s leaders believe that America is in decline. They believe this not only because their country’s sheer size will make them the largest economy on the planet by 2030 but also because they believe their long-term thinking and competent, consistent leadership have outshone America’s in so many ways. The Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure and education – a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality – and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals. Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.

**Coinbase** - IPOing through a directly listing on April 30th, this is kind of an obvious play. They make a SHIT ton of money and are the King broker in Crypto and the most mainstream with their revenue growing from half a million in 2019 to 1.1 Billion in 2020

**Roblox** - This is strictly here because they are the amazon of gaming. People are able to make money off of Roblox and that makes it a great growth company, really any company that you can make money off of is suitable for huge growth not to mention their insane money spending crowd of kids

**Disney** - hear me out. Expansion coming for disneyland to build two more parks. Their Disney+ series is only going to get better with more marvel and star wars original content and anyone that is a parent knows how good Disney+ is. Also, once everything opens up they will be making money off theaters + their new movie releases on Disney+ to watch from home. I think they have plenty of growth left.

Drive Shack is a company that owns and operates golf courses and the restaurants/ bars associated with them. Between the established subsidiaries Drive Shack, and American Golf there are a combined 43 public facilities and 15 private clubs operated by the company.

They also have an un-established new brand called Puttery set to open three new locations in the coming years. Puttery will be a mini golf experience that should attract more diverse interests beyond the typical golfing crowd. In addition to direct ownership, they also offer management services for to other golf courses.

The overwhelming majority of their operations are in California, but they also have sites in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, New York, and Texas.

**Financial Overview:**

*Preemptive TLDR: Revenue has been increasing and they're trending toward profitability. Although it may be hindered by further expansion.*

During the 2020 year, net cash flow turned positive as operating expenses were cut and acquisitions were put on hold. This lead to a surprise profit of 13 cents per share for the 4th quarter. Total revenue for the quarter despite limited operating capacity was 60.3 million which was the third lowest performing quarter out of the last 15 they've reported.

For those who care to look for themselves you can find financials [here.](https://ir.driveshack.com/financial-information)

**Growth Potential:**

With California set to lift COVID restrictions in mid June, their operations should begin to see normal functions again. In addition their new brand Puttery should now face less hurdles for its debut.

The backlog of events (like wedding receptions for example), the desire to get out of the house, and the return of business related travel and social functions all pose a great opportunity for short term potential. Being both outdoors and easily socially distancing also helps protect the company's potential should there be more lock downs for whatever reason.

**My Holdings**: 150 shares as of right now

**FINAL TLDR:** *The company has a lot of potential for growth. It's worth the effort of looking into them ahead of earnings in early May.*"|investing|Drive Shack, the reopening play you never heard of|19.0|0.78

I posted this in r/cars, but I am also very interesting in your input on this, having an (admittedly hobby level) interest in both cars and investments through stocks.  Who do you think will be the future winners? Technology wise, we are seeing an increased pace of development, further surged by COVID. How will giants like **VW**, **Daimler**, **GM** and **BMW** fare? The common thread among these are they are all relatively low priced. VW is heading to become the largest EV maker in 2023, Daimler and BMW are making luxury cars competing with Tesla and the Chinese, and GM seem to have plans to retake the American markeds (I am personally skeptical of the latter, but we will see)

**VW** has already gone up 40% this year, € 243 as we speak, and once it passes 325 it will go past a Price/Earnings rate of 10.

How about **Hyundai**? They recently laid down a plan for further EV development, decreasing production cost. It is likely this will mean their profits will increase despite high investments, which is not reflected in today's value.

How about the reigning kings? **Toyota Motor Corporation** are the world's largest in terms of production volume, being okay priced with a P/E rating of 10. Their insistence on hydrogen as a fuel source is certainly very interesting, and it should be noted they actually don't have a single pure EV in their range currently. Will the future development be hydrogen driven?

**BMW** are also currently well run, with a P/E of 8.5. The public seems to gobble them up, despite some ... unconventional and arguably arrogant decisions not taken lightly by the enthusiasts and older fanbase.

**Porsche**, which I admittedly am a bit biased for (still aiming for a 911 at some point), already had a large surge - and I wish I got into the stocks during January. Is it too late though?  According to Chris Harris on a [Top Gear video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gTZ9QRTtfQ) posted yesterday, they are set for some very interesting developments, switching over to **synthetic fuels**, and now targeting the Macan crowd, after surging Taycan sales (which I can anecdotally attest to, I see dozens every day here in the EV capital of Norway, Oslo). They also have some of their best, [Frank Walliser](https://presskit.porsche.de/motorsport/en/mediaguide-2017/topic/gt-programs/porsche-gt-team/info/driver/dr-frank-steffen-walliser-porsche-gt-team-wec-gt-2017.html), at their helm, which seems promising.

How about the Chinese? **Dongfeng Motor** and **Saic motors**? They seem cheap, but I am still skeptical of their capabilities and reputation.

Finally here is a compilation of companies, (credit goes to a Norwegian article summarizing this issue). My personal favorites which I am looking to invest into are highlighted in bold.

As 2021 marches on which one of these companies would you place your bets on, personally? Why/why not? How do you think technology development, regulations and stricter rules as well as consumer habits shape the future?

&gt;

**Verified Users of 56 million**  
Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) of 6.1 million  
Assets on Platform of $223 billion, representing 11.3% asset market share

Trading Volume of $335 billion  
**Total Revenue of approximately $1.8 billion**  
**Net Income of approximately $730 million to $800 million**  
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion

In my opinion, these numbers are absolutely nuts.

Revenue, and earnings for Q1 2021, will higher than the WHOLE of 2020. Put simply, this company makes BANK.

Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing's rise, and we can't extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.

But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN's annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. (I've calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)

I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won't be participating in it. It's pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days

But let's say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income.)

The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) &lt; $100 Billion.

The gloomy update comes just as energy stocks, which had been battered a day earlier, found their footing as optimism over global growth remains steady. Europe, which remains in lockdowns, is expected to mount a stronger recovery.

The International Monetary Fund lifted its global growth forecast to 6% in 2021, up from its prior forecast of 5.5%, citing the ongoing progress of the vaccine deployment worldwide. The IMF forecast the euro zone to grow 4.4% in 2021. The faster roll out of vaccines in the U.S. continues to spur the reopening process, with California California Governor Gavin Newsom saying the state will lift most restrictions by June 15.

Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), APA (NASDAQ:APA) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) were among the leaders in the energy sector, with the the latter up more than 3%. 

Financials, however, failed to participate in the broader rally cyclicals, as the run up in regional banks paused. 

State Street (NYSE:STT), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) were among the laggards with just days to go until the major Wall Street banks kick off the first quarter earnings season in earnest.

Welcome...  

Let me start off with the overall market and speculation regarding e Sports. 

https://preview.redd.it/41s9l13yngr61.png?width=600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=842211b13348dc7e77610a6e39f33047c06b63e6

* [February 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgK9aDsgzl0) Q&amp;amp;A with Ann Hand the CEO at 2:25 - **Great Video to get to know SLGG!**

This graph is a bit simple, but it's clear to see e sports would be lead into the multi-billions. If you're here because you want to read Papa Cohen is going to send us to the moon and you're looking for an exit strategy, then this isn't for you. What we see is E Sports is a mere child in the scheme of things. For you smooth brained apes out there, imagine being able to invest into the coverage of football when people wore leather helmets and baseball players didn't take steroids.   


We can clearly see that SLGG has a market cap of about 156M and the current revenue of E Sports in general is roughy 1.48 Billion in 2020. For sake of argument we can say the 1.48B is strictly revenue and SLGG's cap (not revenue) is around 1/10 that size. So what is to be made of this? We have all witnessed the Gamestop short squeezes and yes, there are parallels... but this investment isn't AMC, BB, GME, or fucking Bed Bath and Beyond. This is a LONG term investment and your entrance point is the most important factor to your returns.  


As provided by [u/brbbins1](https://www.reddit.com/user/brbbins1/) short interest is extremely high. I'll repost his DD here.

...but in regard to short interests and squeezes does this look familiar at all?  


https://preview.redd.it/558olgjnqgr61.png?width=1930&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=33a79201ff31ef3d8ca3c42dc7091fb5b760125d

If you're looking me to say that SLGG will moon and this will be another short squeeze meme play.. then you're wrong. Could it 100% gain.. definitely so, but dickheads on this subreddit are far too concerned with SLGG being the next GME to realize it's full potential. In my opinion, SLGG lacks the overall attention and coverage gamestop had to recreate the same squeeze. That isn't to say a similar squeeze couldn't be much more powerful or stronger than GME's, but we are missing the catalysts and buying power to do so. Regardless, as posted before, E Sports is in an infancy stage and basing your investment worth off a squeeze will prove detrimental to not only yourself, but the growth of the brand. Let me remind you that investing into a company via stock is investing into the brand. Forget whatever the fuck Ryan Cohen is doing and if GME just rose 10%. Focus on what SLGG needs to thrust itself into being a household name. Everyone has shopped at a Gamestop... what the fuck is a super league in comparison. Stop comparing. An acquisition by GME would not only stunt SLGG's growth, but it would be very ill timed while Gamestop is filing for shares to be sold and a possible recount to fuck the SEC.  


 Yes, i'm aware that the SEC put out new rules for shorts to be announced within a period much shorter than 30 days as before. The reality is, what make you think these motherfuckers won't play hot potatoes like it's their kid's 5th birthday in order to neglect ownership of shorted shares. What we saw with Gamestop very well might be one of a lifetime and SLGG stock holders need to stop pretending this shit is crypto. You're in this for the long term 1-10 years... or you're playing yourself. Simple as that.  


We will be faced with massive shorts. SLGG could hit $4. Who gives a flying fuck if you understand what you're invested into. By the time big hedge money even gets close to bankrupting this company... the same GME board that you dickride to buy out SLGG will likely step in. I'm not saying we need GME involvement at all. What i'm saying is, SLGG is a low hanging fruit that can't be mentioned  on WSB. We have 1.8k members here compared to 9 million. Meaning, if we had the type of attention these other subreddits got, then popping this 600% squeeze wouldn't be an issue at all.   
Furthermore, the SLGG and GME camps share board members of the same kin. You really think that a company that just burst a short squeeze would let their fellow e sports company crumble under bankruptcy due to shortage? It's obvious they would step in because they're fighting the same battle. This isn't the catalyst we need, though. It is besides the fact.   


We see this with prototype Gamestop locations that are lan centers. We see this with all of the partnerships behind the scenes literally making a conglomerate. If you're too lazy too figure that out and want gains, then sell. Otherwise, be in for a turbulent storm and the ultimate cure to this all is bringing more attention to the overall true value of SLGG. There are plenty other E Sports stocks, but SLGG holds the right ti a patent that can't be replicated or duplicated.   


They hold the rights to in person 3rd person bot viewing of ANY game for display. This means movie theaters, gaming hubs, e sports betting, and might very well conflict what Twitch and Youtube have going on. Stop asking for price predictions. Stop waiting for whales to invest and just fucking HOLD. Buy the dips and lower your cost average if needed (not financial advice), but stop sitting here waiting for someone to save you on your delinquent ass mis-informed gamble. Study the company and push the company if you believe in it. That is the essence of shareholding."|investing|DD on fundamentals and growth of Super League Gaming $SLGG|41.0|0.71

Hey Guys, so this is my second DD on a company so please be nice, let me know what you think. I recently came across this company due to NFTs which was very surprising because I had no idea Playboy was even a public company. It looks like they recently went public through a SPAC merger with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. I had no idea what the company was about except for what most people know it as, a nude magazine company, so I thought of NFTs on hot girls of course that will sell, since we all know sex sells, look at only fans. And BTW the CEO did confirm they are doing NFTs for sure and is in the midst of working on this business opportunity.

After doing some more DD into the company I found out that it was a sound company and its looking to make a big come back. That is why I want to do a breakdown of the company and its potential. I think they deserve some attention.

Note: I do have shares in the company, and I plan on holding long term.

**Marketing/Branding**

So let’s start with Playboy as a brand. Almost everyone knows the bunny symbol. It is one of the most iconic globally known brands out there. And that is why I think this company will have a very bright future depending on how they market themselves. These are some of the impressive numbers in terms of their outreach. Playboy is ranked in the top 40th on list of world’s most powerful brands by licensing Global. 3 billion of global consumer spending, massive global reach, 1million active digital commerce consumers, over 180+ countries, 97% global un aided brand awareness.

Now looking at their business these are currently the sectors that they involved in. Each of these are multibillion-dollar markets.

1. sexual wellness 388 billion
2. style&amp; apparel 1.9 trillion
3. gaming &amp; lifestyle 1.4 trillion
4. beauty &amp; Grooming 434 billion

This means that they have ALOT more room to grow.

**Lines of business (how do they make their money)**

Their current main focuses are on style &amp; Apparel and sexual wellness. Which offers the greatest growth in terms of sales and business expansion. You can see this clearly in their most current revenue reported for q4 2021.

\- sexual wellness - 139 million in revenue

\- style &amp; apparel - 124.4 million in revenue

\- Gaming &amp; Lifestyle - 16.6 million in revenue

\- Beauty &amp; Grooming - 16.2 million in revenue

But besides the first 2 areas that I’ve mentioned that are also looking to expand into gaming and beauty and grooming. Gaming would be involvement in the gambling industry like opening casinos in China or India, maybe sponsors with online poker companies for promotion. For beauty and groom this would be cosmetic products, which that actually have some already on their website.

Playboy is currently working on expanding and re-establishing their brand presence. They have close to 9 million plus followers on Instagram as well as many influencers and celebrities that is helping to promote their products through collaborations. Examples: Ariana grande, Beyonce, Kylie Jenner, Steve Aoki, Travis Scott, Lizzo.

Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. Here are some of the examples.

\- walmart, CVS pharmacy

\- alibaba, supreme, taobao

check their investor presentation they outline over 20 brands they a collaborating with. [https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c)

As you can see from their business model they are switching to a more online presence. They acquired YANDY and is in the midst of transforming the playboy platform into an ecommerce destination.

**Expansion and vision**

Playboy has been expanding into other areas of the world as well as trying to bridge the gap between generations. In their most recent investor report they outlined that they will be trying to expand further into the Asian market driving sales into China and India with their new apparels. In terms of new generation penetration Gen Z and millennials has been the focused on their marketing brand, lots of shifting to younger females.

**Financials**

A closer look at their financials you can see that they have been growing quite significantly.

[https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd)

As you can see, they outperformed their sales DURING a pandemic. So, you could only imagine in the coming year what they will be able to do. Their performance for 2020 was absolutely smashing. YOY of 89% and fourth quarter revenue up 118%. They actually had to raise their guidance that they will be able to exceed 200 million in sales for 2021 which is amazing. In terms of their balance sheet, you can see that they lost a lot less money in terms of their overall revenue compared to 2019. Their P/S ratio is around 5 which is very comparable to the industry average. Their quick ratio is 7 with a gross margin of %84. (on finwvz)

**Their management team is stunning and set up for success.**

[**https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership**](https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership)

If you do a quick search Glassdoors you can see that their company has received a 4.1 rating which is pretty good for a company that’s growing.

**Other Analyst and Stock Price**

Let’s look at the predictions in price - Analyst prediction seems to be in consensus that this is a growing company and is due for some growth in the price.

Zacks - buy rating

tip ranks - high of $35

[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast)

**Downsides for the company**

Playboy over the past couple of decades have always been the center of criticism for objectifying woman, and this is what the company will try to tackle. Recently they have made some very significant changes in their business model and their branding, trying to drive gender equality and move away from its history of misogynistic views of women but more towards self-expression/art/fashion.

You can see this in their magazine covers and overall focus for their photographs. Even the New York times did a piece on this in 2019, you can read here. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html)

In order to prevail over this, it’s going to come down to the leadership and how they are able to pivot themselves away from the traditional views of Playboy being a misogynistic entity and more of a sexual wellness sand gender expression brand.

Other down sides to the company include lots of competitors. There are many apparel companies like Victoria Secret, Nike and adidas that can compete with Playboy. In the sexual wellness space competitors include Lifestyle and Church &amp; Dwight (they make Trojan). Most sexual awareness brands have a very good grip on their customers in terms of brand loyalty so it will be hard for Playboy to draw them away.

**TLDR**

Pros

\- Good Growth, shown by the revenue and has been putting up impressive growth numbers

\- Lots of room to run for their sales, involved in multi-industries able to capitalize on many different forms of revenue

\- Good Management – very experienced individuals that can get the work done so the company can start making money

\- Brand is well known, lots of sources to market, pretty much markets itself without the company having to spend too much.

\- Involvement in many lines of business (CBD, NFTs, cosmetics)

\- Companies has royalties they can collect

\- Movement away from its history and trying to rebrand towards a different audience, which is young females and empowering them.

\- Growing market which gives more available room for Playboy to expand and gain more business without having to compete for market share

Cons

\- Competition with other large players in each of the spaces that it is involved in

\- Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals – with the whole cancel culture I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women

\- Might be spreading too thin with so many lines of business

Summary: I think this is a good company and has room to run till $35 at least. I think if they keep putting up these revenue numbers, they will likely hit 50 -60 dollars. I honestly think they will reach their target of 300 million ins sales before 2025. Their estimates are very realistic given how fast they are growing and how large of the presence they have in Asia."|investing|Playboy - Excitement for you and your wallet (Potential 2-4x)|21.0|0.63

Buying a property as an investment and not a home seams like an extremely high risk play. The money i could get for rent here would probably only break me even on taxes in my state, let alone the other expenses that go into being a land lord. What I've been told here is that you're looking to levarage the money you borrow from the bank and make money on the appreciation of the property. 

What if the neighborhood turns to shit?? What if you buy at the peak moments of the sellers market and the value of the home drops drastically. Isn't that leverage going to be equally as bad to the downside? If i put down $100,000 for a $500,000 home and the value drops to $400,000 by years end...

""This may be surprising for some,but I’m going to try to explain why in my opinion this is an undervalued,and misunderstood company. First you have to understand southern car culture. There isn’t a lot to do in the southern states,and middle america. This results in most people pouring money into their cars as one of their main hobbies. My brother owns a performance car shop in west virginia. He told me yesterday that this has been his busiest month in the last 5 years since he started. This is because people have gotten their stimulus checks or saved during the whole pandemic and now that the summer is approaching once again what is one of the things they are going to do with their money? They want to upgrade their car. I asked him which businesses he thinks are benefiting the most from the uptick. One of the first and the only public company he listed is Holley “They pretty much have a near monopoly on a lot of the aftermarket parts especially classic cars and classic trucks parts”

Now that I have somewhat explained the culture and why I think the company is getting a huge uptick from stimulus checks.let's get into the meat,and potatoes of this trade. This is a spac at near nav($10.20). This company is only valued $1.5b despite having 580m revenue last year and 25% YOY growth. They are rapidly taking over the aftermarket part market through acquisitions. Including expanding into the aftermarket EV car market.

It is an extensive ecosystem which is the backbone underpinning a growing economy. Waste Connections operations stand to materially benefit from the industrial and residential waste offshoot in light of Biden’s infrastructure plan, which targets growth in transportation and logistics in and to secondary markets (in which WCN dominates): 

*“The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days.  It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.” –* [*Biden speech on American Jobs Plan, March 31 2021*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/)

Furthermore, the plan aims for a complete overhaul of critical infrastructure including the replacement of all lead water piping. Biden aims to further jumpstart American manufacturing output by increasing factories in primary and secondary markets. The industrial and residential waste byproduct of Biden’s plan will materially increase collection and processing volumes at municipal an non-municipal solid waste landfills, of which WCN owns and operates 74 in secondary regions.

WCN focuses on secondary and rural markets as opposed to urban cities, and is able to achieve industry leading margins due to lack of competition resulting in strong pricing power and low customer churn. Over 40% of solid waste revenues are generated under exclusive arrangements (Residential: 7 years or longer for rural; municipal shorter in nature and have competitive bidding process — Commercial, industrial, and E&amp;P service agreements typically range from 1-5 years). WCN vertically integrates its waste collection business with owning and operating landfills and transfer stations in key markets which further serves as a strategic advantage, capping competition. 

It maintains incredible pricing power drives single digit annual increases to recurring revenues; 13.1% CAGR since 2014; and industry leading free cash flow and earnings margins vs. peers. 

In sum, WCN is a high-quality, defensive name providing an essential service in an increasingly competitive environment. Given its industry-leading growth profile, robust (and sustainable) FCF generation, and dominance of secondary markets, you should consider the company a core holding and a safe play against volatility. It continues to innovate in the recycling and green energy conversion space, both catalysts to future growth and investment.

       Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024.

Looking at the EY average for the end of each week, Pre-pandemic, there are 155 weeks in total where the EY traded below 6%. I decided to see what the subsequent 12-month total return (TR) was when yields were this low. Here are those findings:

- Average TR 3.1%
- Median TR 2.8%
- Largest positive TR 8.1% (03/06/2020-03/06/2021)
- Largest negative TR -3.6% (08/29/2014-08/29/2015)
- Number of positive returns 132 weeks
- Number of negative or zero returns 23 weeks

A few bits I find interesting, yet not surprising, is that the best TR period with historically low yields came during a period of high volatility (COVID) while the worst TR period came from a period of a relatively long period grinding-ly low yields.

Surprisingly, the number of weeks with a positive TR vs negative or zero TR is a ratio of 5.74:1, not something I would have expected. Then again, in the grand scheme of things, sub-6% EY is itself new territory. 

In the end, the average and median returns are quite meager and it’s likely that the subsequent 12-month return in this space, from 2021 Q1, will fall below these numbers barring some short lived period of high volatility with a recovery, e.g. COVID-19 like period."|investing|High Yield when they are Low Yield|49.0|0.86

disclaimer : i am not a financial advisor I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.

company overview : founded at south africa in 1895. drdgold invented itself in the late 1900's and now is a world leader (although operates only in south africa) in retreatment of gold from tailing dams, in 2018 almost doubled its reserves with the acquisition of wrtrp from world platinum and gold mining giant sibanye stillwaters for majority stake in the company, traded primary at jse and secondary as nyse adr.

i believe this company and inevitably the stock is about to enter, or more accurately maintain and accelerate a fast growth phase which will potentially multiply the company value numerous times .

my belief comes from the company past present and its clear and very solid future that is almost secured, on this post i will explain each one of the three and why those are contributing its growth potential and the implementation of the spoken potential.

first of all, let's talk about the past of the company in the last critical 5 years:

performance :

the company eps took off 520% percent from 2016

the roe jumped from 4 to 16 percent

the company profit margin skyrocketed from 2.55% in 2016 to 15% in 2020,

fact that is important(from reasons i will explain later) is that the profit margin in 2019 was 2.8%

the explain later part, or cash flow :

drdgold numbers weren't really great from a really fantastically good reason :capital expenditure .

the percent of fcf only from financing and operating activities that lost in investment activities in 2016 was around 75 percent, in 2017, a weak year that they use to plant the seeds of future growth , the rate was 1600% percent, they lost cashflow that year , 2018 75% , 2019 105% and in 2020, after years of enormous growth rate in cash flow invested they invested 38% less and the fcf from financing and operating activities that reinvested was 12%, while their earnings got bigger and the profit margin and roe skyrocketed, they invested for future growth for years and now instead of a first bud to peek from the surface of the well watered ground, a mighty oak tree welcomed the gardners in the morning, but as big a oak tree is, i believe this stock is a giant sequoia.

why is the growth at 2020 was so big:

the reserves acquisitions from Sibanye stillwater wasn't functional until 2019-2020, and i believe that it still have a room to become fully functional, as the company stated, they are in stage 2 of the wrtrp , the first was to start operating and the second is a high volume processing plant near the dumps.

 

present and sustained future or the affects of the deal outside gain in reserves :

gold is Sibanye stillwater third biggest export, the first is pgm, and as the ceo stated, drdgold will start in partnership with Sibanye stillwater to process pgm tailings, which will not only cause a huge vertical growth and huge growth in profit, it will make the company less dependant in the cycle of the gold price, and will make more investors to buy it.

additionally their use of big data helps stabilize and slightly improve(when multiplied in 20 million tons a month is quite a bit) their operations

some more future :

in the annual report the company wrote about their strategic outlook which is a huge vertical growth phase by those means:

2021-2026

DRDGOLD – through acquisitions, be able to offer integrated, sustainable tailings management solutions with international reach and by doing this, expand our role in environmental clean-up in the interest of sustainable land use, reduced pollution and societal upliftment

Platinum group metals – consider opportunities through our anchor shareholder, locally and internationally

2027 and beyond

DRDGOLD – consolidate all surface tailings in South Africa and look to international opportunities for surface mining

those, combined with horizontal growth by improving the efficiency of the current facilities, building west rand storage facility, and optimasion the use of already majority of the water grey water,

will make them a big ass square, so my conclusion is that drdgold will experience massive growth at the next 5 and the next 10 years.

i hope you found my post useful."|investing|Drd gold , a vertical growth gold mine|10.0|0.67

Quite interesting comment in the end:

from ""EcoQuant"":

// Well, one can offer the mindless ""contrarian trade"" argument, but to what end?

In substance, what should be proper prices and earnings expectations are difficult to estimate.

First, there is no documented precedent for such a mammoth energy transition.  Historical comparisons are *so different* even if available.  What do we know about markets and shares during the transition from camphor to whale oil?  Or the displacement of the latter by petroleum and gas? 

Second, this is an odd-duck technology transformation, not a classical energy transformation based upon mining and extraction and analog elements, although it isn't completely devoid of that.  The analogy always is various digital electronics, whether semiconductors and computing and digital photography.  In those markets, the best and most expensive are offered first, and then, as demand grows, proceeds fund development of versions which are as capable, but much cheaper, and the most expensive are offered, in subsequent years, models which cost the same but now have more capability. The price of a unit of goodness goes down. You can always get the cheaper by waiting, but then there are no advantages *now*. Zero Carbon energy isn't entirely like that. The idea of changing out wind turbines for more efficient ones does not quite work.  It mind work for solar PV, however, assuming the inverters can keep up.  All these elements influence costs and pricing.

Third, if PV and wind are cheaper to generate with technology a year from now than today, new players to markets using these cheaper technologies can undercut zero Carbon offerings which are older.  To some degree, the technology means these energy sources are competing against themselves.  That may seem bad, but realize whether considering computers or digital cameras or smart phones, these successes were not hindered by such rollouts.  Now, that may be because those are a consumer marketplace and wind and solar are wholesale business marketplaces, but in the long run, shouldn't the behavior be the same?

Fourth, scaling up wind and solar and storage to the level needed for a global transformation itself imposes resource and financial costs. It is notable that Copper funds have also traded up, because cheaper sources of Copper are being exhausted, and Copper is needed everywhere, in PV, wind, and in EVs and storage. Prices for companies which assumed one cost of Copper are discovering that, in time, these will be higher.  That's not destructive, but it has an influence. 

Fifth, there's the wild card of software and innovation and improvements in the basic technology, especially concerning energy storage. A sudden innovation could make the grid work better, or storage be cheaper even if the chemistry hasn't changed, or make overlay energy networks the *de facto* model. This affects prices and expectations, too.

In net, these short term concerns are just that, and anyone who is betting long term on fossil fuels may profit in the short run, but will lose out in the long, no matter the fate of the current U.S. administration, its policies, or whoever wins the next Congress or Presidency. A contrarian political leadership can throw artificial impediments into the path of continued rollout, but that will not be popular with corporations, who have now committed billions to making this a reality. 

Those continuing to back fossil fuels are equivalent to those who invested in horses and buggies in 1904.  //"|investing|Why are fossil fuel investors in the green for 2021? The clean energy trade seems overcrowded for now - JOHN DIZARD Opinion FTfm|27.0|0.83

U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   

First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years."|investing|U.S. job growth accelerates in March; unemployment rate falls to 6.0%|2600.0|0.97

Edit 2: I added a few more etfs, and I decided to publish the entire doc here for the transparency sake. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR5HjnlzG0EA6wrGmPGZDl9oISgf8ekECzlHUj4zPBW-z-MUH4-N9dwFjOXvD1qcTA29vEoxYT87Unp/pubhtml

Edit 3: The calculation doesn't work for leveraged ETFs (they are not tied to the underlying price of the company, beta decay is a think with leveraged etfs). Also it doesn't work with non-US listed stocks (e.g. finviz doesn't have data for the ESPO stocks https://stockanalysis.com/etf/espo/holdings/)"|investing|I computed the weighted average upside for &gt;100 ETFs.

A lot of this ground has been covered already by places like The Bear Cave but here are some highlights: 

\- This team’s collective experience seems significantly more limited than that of other firms. Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.

\- Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock’s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock’s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another.

\- The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF’s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.

\- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.

\-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position."|investing|ARKK Morningstar review: Unrestrained, Unaware, and Unconcerned|91.0|0.79

&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James' office says it found that Tether sometimes held no reserves to back its cryptocurrency's dollar peg. It said that, from mid-2017, the company had no access to banking and misled clients about liquidity issues.

&gt;In a 2019 filing, the attorney general's office said that Bitfinex handed $850 million to a Panama entity called Crypto Capital without disclosing it to investors. Executives at Bitfinex and Tether then allegedly engaged in a series of transactions that opened up Tether's cash reserves to Bitfinex.

&gt;”Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines,"" James said in a statement Tuesday.

&gt;”Tether's claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie,"" she added.

&gt;”These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system.""

**What is tether?**

[Tether](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) is a 1 to 1 dollar peg cryptocurrency. It accounts for [60-80% ](https://coinlib.io/coin/BTC/Bitcoin)of all trading volume on cryptocurrency exchanges.

**What is the significance of tether?**

Please read the price manipulation section on it’s [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) page. In a nut shell, tether has been strategically printed (backed by nothing) and used to manipulate the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency market. There is a high [correlation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2021-01-14/research-affiliates-quant-warns-of-bitcoin-market-manipulation) between how much tether is printed and Bitcoin’s price.

**What happens now?**

This has long been one the cryptocurrency’s market biggest fears. That the price increases were mostly due to artificial demand. As to what happens next, I’m not sure, and no one really knows. I can speculate that Powell and Yellen may use this firepower to enact stricter legislation on the cryptocurrency market. Maybe Tether needs to be banned altogether. But if tether is banned what will happen to the artificially inflated Bitcoin/cryptocurrency market?

[Tether recently released a statement in an attempt to show that all its stablecoins are fully backed. However, it fails to disclose what it's holdings are. “For all we know, they could have $25 in their bank account and the rest could be in Bitcoin.”](https://decrypt.co/63577/tether-attestation-takeaways)

I understand that solar isn't something most people are enthusiastic about. However, as a decades long solar industry veteran, I see something happening, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, SUNW:**

* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* SUNW accumulated deficit of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their deficit is increasing, despite being well beyond a reasonable period of growth, having a receding market share, and having shown little/no profit for nearly two decades.
* SUNW currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California. This is an incredibly low number of installs for a solar company that primarily operates in a State where solar is mandatory for all new homes. While I'm aware SUNW does a few commercial projects, it doesn't make up for the baffling lack of volume, particularly when the profit margins on residential are thicker than commercial.
* SUNW does not manufacture solar panels or equipment. SUNW does not develop any proprietary hardware or software to my knowledge. They are simply a solar reseller that operates off of debt, similar to RUN and NOVA, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* SUNW is facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* SUNW is also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* SUNW's biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as RUN, NOVA, TSLA, and SPWR. Currently SUNW offers nothing unique to give them an advantage over their competition.
* SUNW's stock price seems to be benefiting solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing similarly classed solar companies, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, their biggest competitor RUN was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.SUNW was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that SUNW's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump &amp; dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from SUNW: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. If you're unfamiliar with the solar industry, the solar ETFs are a solid alternative.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies &gt; Panel manufacturers &gt; Financing Companies &gt; Large retailers &gt; Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I have more solar customers than Sunworks.

Disclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought Friday (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.

TLDR: SUNW doesn't make a profit, hasn't made a profit in over a decade, and doesn't appear to have any unique software, hardware, or business model.

My question is if it would be reasonable to invest in Turkey. Not necessarily in stocks, since as I said Turkey might face a huge crisis in the near future. I was thinking more in terms of real estate. For example, Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, it has and will always have a certain appeal to a lot of people that makes it valuable whatever happens (well, excluding the city itself being destroyed, but kind of unrealistic). So, for a person living in the eurozone like myself, would an investment in real estate in, say, Istanbul, be a good decision?

**Key takeaways**

* Data suggests that institutional announcements, inflows into GBTC, and miner reward cuts help drive Bitcoin prices
* The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer price appreciation
* Bitcoin CO2 emissions are the same as Greece's and rise in line with prices. Our ESG reading is low on E, and mixed on S &amp; G

## Bitcoin supply is artificially scarce, demand drives prices

Just like in other commodities, supply and demand drive Bitcoin prices. But there are twists. Bitcoin output is capped at 21mn coins and supply growth halves every 4 years. It is designed to become increasingly constrained. So demand swings are key to price moves. Indeed, we show major institutional announcements and miner reward cuts have been followed by upward Bitcoin moves. Similarly, flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to lead weekly Bitcoin returns. A while ago, we argued a surge in trading liquidity was a key feature of the asset. Yet Bitcoin remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining), and can just handle 14k transactions per hour relative to Visa's stated 236mn.

## No good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up

Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism. As such, the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply. Unlike other asset classes, our work shows liquidity bursts measured by the Amihud ratio caused positive Bitcoin returns. Average 10y Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is about 1.3 despite stellar returns, compared to 1 for NDX. Plus Bitcoin returns are sensitive to increased dollar demand. A net inflow into Bitcoin of $93mn may result in a 1% price rise, while the analogue for gold is more than 20 times higher.

## Our Bitcoin ESG read: low on E, mixed on S and G

Few ESG providers factor Bitcoin exposure into ESG ratings. But its Environmental score is poor: the network emits today about 60mn tons of CO2, the same as Greece. Plus a $1bn fresh inflow into Bitcoin may cause CO2 to rise by the equivalent of 1.2mn ICE cars. As hash power today is mostly in coal-fired Xinjiang, a link between prices, energy demand &amp; CO2 means Bitcoin is tied to Chinese coal. Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world's 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan. On Social &amp;Governance issues, democratization of money and anonymity of ownership can be positive, as it is helpful in territories with corrupt financial systems and lowers costs by eliminating intermediaries. But negatives outweigh. Anonymity aids nefarious activities. Reprisk, an ESG tracker, found 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy.

## CBDCs are kryptonite for crypto, but DeFi is intriguing

A number of central banks (notably, the ECB) are talking about launching retail digital currencies that may use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are aimed at protecting CBs against private sector stablecoins (such as Diem), as CBs view Bitcoin et al as (spec) assets, not currencies. Also, the growth of decentralized finance (""DeFi"") shows the strength of Ethereum; its computational ability is vital to DeFi applications. Yet Ethereum has similarESG issues as Bitcoin, even if it may have better tools to tackle them. DeFi is interesting, but small and faces challenges in going mainstream. We think it hasn't a compelling lending proposition at present, and its diversification makes it challenging for the mass market."|investing|BofA Global Research - Bitcoin's Dirty Little Secrets|200.0|0.83

If you are somewhat familiar with leveraged ETFs you have no doubt heard the many warnings that surround them. Warnings involving phrases like ""decaying value"" or ""daily rebalancing"". However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as ""daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days""; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at *any* point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?

All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term ""Beta Slippage"": Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?

To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.

If you aren't curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.

If you are:

I used TD Ameritrade's API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF's leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.

So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.

Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!

I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.

**What is Zedge?**

Zedge is a phone customization app that runs a marketplace for users to download wallpapers and ringtones. As of the latest earnings report, Zedge had **482M installs** on both the play store and app store, and **35.4M monthly active users**.

The app generates revenue from a combination of advertising, paid subscriptions, and their Zedge Premium marketplace, which allows creators to sell their own digital content.

It has a current market cap of **$168M dollars**

Ticker symbol : **ZDGE**

&amp;#x200B;

**The growth story**

While zedge’s user growth has been unimpressive over the pandemic (13.7% for installs and 3.3% for monthly active users), its revenue growth is likely behind its recent increase in stock price.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q2 2020: $2.6M Revenue, $0.1M Earnings, $0.026 ARPMAU, $0.6M cash flow**

**Q2 2021: $5.3M Revenue, $2.5M earnings $0.049 ARPMAU, $2.3M cash flow**

&amp;#x200B;

**101%** revenue growth, **3087%** earnings growth, **87.7%** ARPMAU growth, **269%** cash flow growth

&amp;#x200B;

Zedge has had revenue growth quarter on quarter for the past three quarters, with advertising revenue being the main driver.

This growth was due to “optimization of ad waterfall and an increase in advertising rates relating to year-end ad budge”, as per their most recent earnings call.

While I could talk about more numbers, I think it would be easier to look at the 3rd table from their latest [earnings report](https://investor.zedge.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4658616).

Link: [https://imgur.com/lrByTCo](https://imgur.com/lrByTCo)

This 100% revenue increase has occurred while operating expenses have stayed almost the same, increasing marginally from **$2.25M to $2.4M**, leading to greater profit margins.

Management is forecasting revenue to increase between **75% to 80%** for FY21, which would be an increase in revenues from **$9.4m to $16.45M**. (Management were previously

&amp;#x200B;

**Heavy Insider buying**

The stock has seen significant insider buying by the CEO and directors as early as when the stock price was $1 in March of 2020. The good news is that this insider buying has continued on the way up, with insider buying by the CEO and a director at $7 on 01/19/20 and 01/20/20. This (almost) cluster buy shows a high level of conviction by insiders in their company.

However, the CFO did sell at $15 on 03/24/21, but when the stock price has risen this much (almost 1400%) it is natural to take some profits, so this does not worry me. The CEO and director are still yet to reduce their holdings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Solid balance sheet**

According to yahoo finance, Zedge has a **current ratio of 4.65.**

It is cash rich with over **$13.5M** on the balance sheet, and almost debt free with only **492k.**

\*\*In their latest earnings call, they have said that they would like to acquire a company related to ""\*\*mobile gaming, social video, and even mindfulness""

[Source (Yahoo Finance):](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZDGE/key-statistics?p=ZDGE)

&amp;#x200B;

**A reasonable valuation**

As of writing, Zedge trades for **$12.55**, a **25% decrease from its high of $16.93**, which it reached after its stellar earnings report. This tumble in stock price has not been due to any news or change in fundamentals and likely due to the recent downturn in tech and growth stocks.

Zedge, at its current price has a **P/S ratio of 13** based on TTM revenue. If revenue meets management’s guidance for FY21, it trades at a P/S ratio of 10.5.

The **PE ratio is currently 45**, and the forward p/e is 29 based on analyst recommendations. Prior to the most recent earnings release, the stock was trading at a 130 PE ratio

Although this is not cheap, this in my opinion is a reasonable valuation for an almost adtech-like company that is experiencing rapid growth. I believe that this stock would have been trading upwards of $20 dollars if it weren’t for the recent downturn in growth tech stocks.

If we value the stock at a forward PE ratio of 50, my price target for this stock is **$21.60**, ( which is a conservative estimate considering that this is a growth tech stock. The price target by analysts is **$24** (although price targets often mean very little.) This could certainly go much further should market conditions for growth stocks change.

The company could also expand into the NFT market, as it provides a marketplace for unique content like wallpapers. However, this is pure speculation and should not be the reason for investment.

When considering risks, there is the possibility that growth in advertising revenue starts to slow down, however management see no sign of this currently due to their current forecasts. It may be important to note management were forecasting 20% revenue growth for FY21 in prior earnings calls.

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting.  
They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.2 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 50MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float &amp; high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

**Conclusion**  
MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.

**Disclaimer:**  
I am long MKTY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it.

The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

″We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

But the industry capitulated after the latest boom in bitcoin’s price. The surge has drawn in institutional investors, corporations and fintech players, and the infrastructure to hold digital assets is continuing to mature. In the end, it was client demand that won out, according to Rich.

“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

The fact that the right side of the cup is higher than the left side also is technically the most bullish form of C&amp;H pattern.

The problem for gold isn't technical, it's fundamentals. Despite extreme money printing since 2008, USD inflation measured by CPI has been historically low. In a low inflation environment, bonds have thrived and stole the risk/reward from gold. Now after the pandemic you would have thought gold should performed well, which it did, until bitcoin started to become more accepted by institutional investors in the fall of 2020. Institutional investors generally keep their holdings at certain ratios like 50% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash, and 10% inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold can co-exist in a portfolio, but the problem is that they are fighting for the same slice of the pie which is about 10%. Until the adoption curve of bitcoin slows or inflation grows at a yearly 4% or higher, I don't see gold breaking new highs anytime soon.

Gold miners are like gold's version of shitcoins. If you want a momentum driven, lowcap,  and highly volatile version of gold, miners are for you. Gold mining is a stagnant industry with little innovation or promise of growth, their profitability hinges on the mercy of a high gold price. It looks like the miners have already priced in a gold bull market, so if gold enters another true bear market, miners are likely crashing 95% or more because their business model literally dies. There are better high reward industries with better a better outlook to spend your money than miners imo."|investing|My take on Gold's longterm outlook|32.0|0.63

1617160710.0|0.0|t3_mgwz1w|54.0|"In an unusual move, the Federal Trade Commission announced that they have filed suit to block genetic sequencing leader Illumina’s (ILMN) $7.1B merger with the liquid biopsy company Grail.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

The capital of Tokyo currently has about 300 to 400 infections a day, which is close to average since the summer. The state of emergency was just called off and things are going back to relative normal right now. next week, college students across the country will return to campuses, albeit with masks. The Government is even thinking about promoting local travel in June.

But it looks like this could be short-lived. The same Google model that accurately predicted the coronavirus spike in infections at New Year’s predicts that Tokyo will see an enormous increase in infections by April 20. Up to 12,000 a day, which is massively more than the city has ever seen.

If true, the government will have no choice but to call another state of emergency, it will considerably impede recovery prospects. I want to bet on this, but don’t know how to do it without potentially losing my shirt. is there a simple way I could do it using my account using simple financial products?

Update: now I’m thinking about targeting smaller cap stocks that are 1) most likely to get hit by a wider, stricter lockdown than people are used to seeing, and 2) aren’t included in the TOPIX index, which the central bank buys.

* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&amp;#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&amp;#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to 

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit. 
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

&amp;#x200B;

**Why don't you have this automated? I keep getting locked out and I can't see anything. Can you just send me the data with your picks?**

1. Because I'm not an online programmer. If you want to do it for me I'm more than happy to give you the data, but I'm not getting paid for any of this, I just am offering up my personal data tracking in case it helps anyone
2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks
3. No, that's a lot of work and I'm not pushing any particular stock, so you pick yours. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's losses

Management review:

* Compensation
There is a significant bonus for the Board of Director as stated in its annual report 2018:
**""The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $65 million in personnel costs (including stock-based compensation expense), professional fees, and facilities costs to support the growth of our existing business and adjacent areas of opportunity""**

In the same period (CMIIW), the company fire 800 employee.

you can check the detail here:
https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/16/18226581/activision-blizzard-layoffs-executive-pay-unions
but I quote here
**The disparity between bottom-line executive compensation and what the 800 people laid off were making is staggering. Bobby Kotick has become the villain in this story. Kotick drew a $1.75 million salary plus another $26 million or so in stock and other equity awards in 2017. Dennis Durkin, who recently returned to the CFO role and was also put in charge of “emerging business” (figuring out where the company will make its money in the coming years), was given a $3.75 million cash bonus and another $11.3 million in as-yet unearned, performance-based equity**

Maybe this policy makes people judge The CEO, Bobby Kotick is a profit-oriented person - but honestly, which CEO doesn't?

* Destiny exclusivity for Playstation: Wrong strategy? But Bungie Games has divorced with Activision.
* Forcing microtransactions: Do it really bad? Even when the gamer doesn't like it, they keep playing the franchise.

Note:
I'm not a gamer, I play Deck Heroes, Mythgard, other TCG or CCG (unfortunately I don't play Hearthstone), FIFA (a long time ago). Thus I don't have expertise in the genre that Activision published.

Any comment would be very appreciated.

_______________________
Revision I

I will revise my view based on some member's advice. Activision Blizzard has made great games which really difficult to be replicated. Once a gamer plays specific genre or franchise, it will be difficult to switch (do the video game publisher has switching cost as economic moat?). The specific game has a large fan base and not easy to migrate to another title for the same genre.

More revision is upcoming...
_______________________
Original Post:

Economic Moat.

~~Not found. It has no switching cost, like other players in this industry. Has no scale advantage and has no intangible assets that create business advantages like EA. EA license with sport and player make it can’t be replicated by other titles. Unlike Call of Duty players that can move to Fortnite, Valiant, or Counter-Strike. Warcraft players could migrate to Blade and Soul, Elder Scrolls, or Final Fantasy XIV.
So, due to the absence of a strong economic moat, we hope to get a discount to ensure we are within the margin of safety.~~


Financial.
Not bad. Strong balance sheet, at the end of 2020, they have 8.6 B cash, far exceeding its total debt of 3.6 B; another advantage of having tons of cash is they are ready to deploy once potential acquisition exists.
The business makes cash, but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance. It becomes normal these days?


Management.
The increasing number of shares. Need an explanation about this.
Cost analysis: nothing’s suspicious. Good figure of gross profit margin, a good figure of net profit margin. Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.

Valuation
Its PE ratio is similar to EA. I’m surely going to EA due to a stronger economic moat.

Today, NeuroRX (Ticker:BRPA) has announced successful top line results from their phase 3 Zyesami drug trial, which proved a nearly 50 percent increase in survival and recovery from respiratory failure vs. existing covid treatments (best standard of care). And that’s when the drug is administered to patients that have already reached severe/critical covid.

&amp;#x200B;

**FDA Approval**

* NeuroRX is immediately applying for Emergency Use Authorization to get this drug to the people who need it. They already have a stockpile of the drug ready, along with manufacturing and distribution agreements. The CEO of NeuroRX has previously led drug developments for companies like Pfizer and Merck, and was appointed healthcare leadership roles by several different presidential administrations. He is the real deal.

**Nebulized form**

* The drug is administered via IV to hospitalized patients, however NeuroRX has already begun another trial to test an inhaled form of the drug, which is given via nebulizer and designed for use at home/outpatient setting. This could be even bigger than the IV form of the drug, because it could prevent moderately sick patients from ever becoming hospitalized in the first place. And now that the drug has proven it works in the IV form on severe/critical patients to reverse lung damage, the inhaled form which is administered directly to the lungs is even more promising for the moderately sick.

**“BuT cOviD is gOnE!!!!11”**

* While we’ve likely seen the worst of covid, it is not gone and never will be. Especially not in developing countries. Covid for example, is significantly more contagious than the flu. Even here in the US we might not reach herd immunity, plus mutations, people will get tired of getting a vaccine at least once, more likely twice a year etc.
* Additionally, the possible uses for this drug go beyond covid, such as respiratory distress syndrome. There are people who were on queue to receive a double lung transplant because of the damage covid did to their lungs, then were given this drug and a transplant was no longer needed. I believe covid treatment is only the beginning.

I thought the 90% stocks / 10% bonds thing was a smart idea just in case equities pop. I'm not really a fan of the 100% stocks thing, just ain't for me, I definitely see the value in having some diversification.

Well some quick searching led me to Vanguard's Total Bond Index ETF (BND). I didn't put a whole lot in there but I put enough.

First big lesson I'm learning: generalized investing advice doesn't always work for all economic situations. Bonds suck right now. They're getting sold off because the real rate of return is 0 or negative (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is only going to get worse if inflation spikes.

I've taken a small loss on this ETF thanks to the sell off. Nothing major but at this point cash would have been better.

One thing I had been interested in was series I bonds. However, currently the fixed interest rate they're paying is 0%. Sucky. The good news is that in May they'll be issuing new ones with an updated fixed interest rate. I assume that since yields are up, they will have to raise the fixed rate above 0%. I assume it will be low, but low is better than 0.

So anyway, I'm thinking about selling BND for a minor loss and holding the proceeds in cash until May, at which point I will pick up the (hopefully) updated series I bonds. The theory is that I can just hold these bonds without the market affecting them (unlike a bond index), and the inflation-adjusted interest plus the fixed interest will be better than cash. That way I'll continue to get the diversification benefits without the downsides that other bonds are facing at the moment. It's like keeping some extra cash but on steroids.

Of course, I could just hold BND and wait for it to recover... but who knows how many years. That's wasted money.

Thoughts? Did I miss anything with my analysis?  Any other suggestions?

UPDATE: It's done, just need all the transactions to go through tomorrow.  Thanks for the tips and advice."|investing|Thinking about getting out of BND and picking up series I bonds.|20.0|0.74

Due Diligence

**Why Helium?**

* Helium is a Non-renewable, non-synthesizable element that is an irreplaceable component of many growing, high tech industries - MRI magnetics, cloud storage, rocketry, semiconductors, nuclear power, and fiber optics, just to name a few. When used as a coolant and in many manufacturing aspects, there is no substitute.
* Helium is rare on Earth. It is only obtainable by drilling for gas reserves in very particular parts of the world.
* Helium is a $10+Billion industry with a CAGR of 4% (2018 prediction) - 11% (2020 prediction) (sources conflict as the Helium industry is highly concentrated currently with little transparency). Helium overperformed 2015 future-looking estimates by 150%.

**Why Now?**

* Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon: [https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf](https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf)
* The United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been a major player in the Helium industry, accounting for nearly 20% of the global market. However, it was directed to privatize starting in 1996 and will be ending the majority of activity in 2021 having exhausted storage that has existed since the ‘60s, leaving a void in supply. **It’s not every day that a 20% player in an industry just exits the market.**
* Nearly all helium production today comes as a by-product of Natural gas extraction (constituting &lt;1% of gas extracted). The move away from carbon fuels may further constrain helium supply as a consequence.

**Why Desert Mountain Energy (DME)?**

* DME is one of the only companies concentrating exclusively on helium production.
* DME operates in Arizona - the same area the US BLM found mining success in.
* Strong, experienced company leadership that have led multiple mining projects.
* Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining.
* DME is far ahead of all of the other helium-specific mining operations that are just starting to catch on (RHC, Helium One), and in a much better location.

**Why is Arizona Important**

* Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day.
* DME has hit significant Helium on 3/3 test wells drilled.
* Shipping and selling locally is important as gaseous helium can escape storage over time. Local industries include everything from SpaceX to Intel, which recently announced a $20B project to build semiconductor factories close to DME’s property.
* Other major helium players globally are in less stable locations or locations that don’t have strong US relations: Algeria, Qatar, Russia.
* The majority of land DME holds is private, meaning less regulation and quicker time to market.

**Financials and Plans**

* Strong cash on hand via private placement rather than private debt. $13M. Cash on hand used to procure land for both drilling and processing, and for equipment and transportation.
* Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less.
* Current market cap \~$128M, with the vast majority of retail/private ownership.
* Helium is extremely profitable once the operation is up and running. Analysts at Cormark expect DME to operate at 85% net of operating expenses.
* The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices. DME plans to drill 60 - 70 wells over this timespan. Even at conservative yields, we can expect order of magnitude increases to their revenue and market cap over the next decade.
* DME plans to process Helium and concentrate on high-grade Helium which has much higher yields than bulk helium (and is less or irreplaceable in its uses, such as cooling), further specializing operations.
* DME has other projects/holdings - namely land in OK for an oil play, but is concentrating on helium in Arizona right now.

**What’s Next?**

* Test results from wells 4-6 coming in the next few months
* Revenue and contract information towards the end of year.
* My opinion is that It’s entirely possible DME is acquired by a high-usage player local to the Arizona area.

**Risks?**

* Governmental effects, both nationally and locally. For example, the US leveraged helium politically by restricting exports to China in 2015, and if prices were to get out of control they could reverse course on privatization, though there are no indications of this now. (Quite the opposite, actually).
* Locally, the city of Flagstaff was granted a restraining order on DME to prevent drilling on one testing site due to concerns about the local water table (though misleadingly claimed they were fracking, which they are not). The vast majority of DME’s land is procured on private sources away from Flagstaff and is unaffected by this.
* Flow rates could be less successful at their other drill sites. I’ve been very conservative due to this in my future valuation calculations.
* There is barely any institutional ownership of the stock, which could be good or bad depending on which resources you consult.
* Other global supply coming online in the coming years. Largely in areas without close trade ties to the US, and offset by DME’s domestic concentration.
* A large player could ramp up supply to specifically push out the little guy. This would be difficult though. Since other helium production is a by-product of natural gas, this would mean flooding that primary market, which would have harsh consequences.

**My position**

* 2100 shares, continuing to add.

**Factual Summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&amp;#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market volume total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.

**Analysis:**

&amp;#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit."|investing|Coursera: A DD Introduction|33.0|0.82

Vildana Hajric

Everywhere you look, there’s a valuation lens that makes stocks look frothy. Also everywhere you look is someone saying don’t worry about it.

The so-called Buffett Indicator. Tobin’s Q. The S&amp;P 500’s forward P/E. These and others show the market at stretched levels, sometimes extremely so. Yet many market-watchers argue they can be ignored, because this time really is different. The rationale? Everything from Federal Reserve largesse to vaccines promising a quick recovery.

How convinced should anyone be when dismissing the message of metrics like these? To be sure, both the market and economy are in uncharted waters. It’s possible -- perhaps likely -- that old standards don’t apply when something as random as a virus is behind the stress. At the same time, many a portfolio has been squandered through complacency. Market veterans always warn of fortunes lost by investors who became seduced by talk of new rules and paradigms.

“Every time markets hit new highs, every time markets get frothy, there are always some talking heads that argue: ‘It’s different,’” said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer of Mercer Advisors. “We just know from centuries of market history that that can’t happen in perpetuity. It’s just the delusion of crowds, people get excited. We want to believe.”

Source: Robert Shiller’s website
Robert Shiller is no apologist. The Yale University professor is famous in investing circles for unpopular valuation warnings that came true during the dot-com and housing bubbles. One tool on which he based the calls is his cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio that includes the last 10 years of earnings.

While it’s flashing warnings again, not even Shiller is sure he buys it. At 35, the CAPE is at its highest since the early 2000s. If that period of exuberance is excluded, it clocks in at its highest-ever reading. Yet in a recent post, Shiller wrote that “with interest rates low and likely to stay there, equities will continue to look attractive, particularly when compared to bonds.”

relates to Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation Metrics One by One
Another indicator raising eyebrows is called Tobin’s Q. The ratio -- which was developed in 1969 by Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin -- compares market value to the adjusted net worth of companies. It’s showing a reading just shy of a peak reached in 2000. To Ned Davis, it’s a valuation chart worth being wary about. Still, while the indicator is roughly 40% above its long-term trend, “there may be an upward bias on the ratio from technological change in the economy,” wrote the Wall Street veteran who founded his namesake firm.

Persuasive arguments also exist for discounting the signal sent by the “Buffett Indicator,” a ratio of the total market capitalization of U.S. stocks divided by gross domestic product. While it recently reached its highest-ever reading above its long-term trend, the methodology fails to take into consideration that companies are more profitable than they’ve ever been, according to Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.

“It’s looked extended really for the past decade, yet you’ve had one of the best bull markets in U.S. history,” he said. “That’s going to continue to be a metric that does not adequately capture the market’s potential.”

By some measures, S&amp;P 500 valuations already top dot-com era
At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., strategists argue that however high P/Es are, the absence of significant leverage outside the private sector or a late-cycle economic boom points to low risk of an imminent bubble burst. While people are shoveling money into stocks at rates that have signaled exuberance in the past, risk appetite is rebounding after a prolonged period of aversion, according to the strategists, who also cite low interest rates.

“Today is a very different situation -- I don’t think we’ve got a broad bubble,” Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at the firm, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg Television. “Given the level of real rates, where they are, it’s still likely to be broadly supportive for equities versus bonds.”

Another rationale employed to dismiss certain valuation metrics is the earnings cycle. Corporate America is just emerging from a recession, with profits forecast to stage a strong comeback. The strong outlook for profits is why many investors are giving similarly stretched valuations the benefit of the doubt. Trading at 32 times reported earnings, the S&amp;P 500 looks quite expensive, but with income forecast to jump 24% to $173 a share this year, the multiple drops to about 23.

The valuation case becomes more favorable should business leaders continue to blow past expectations. For instance, if this year’s earnings come in at 16% above analyst estimates, as they did for the previous quarter, that’d imply a price-earnings ratio of less than 20. While that exceeds the five-year average of 18, Ed Yardeni is not troubled by what he calls “the New Abnormal.”

“Valuation multiples are likely to remain elevated around current elevated levels because fiscal and monetary policies continue to flood the financial markets with so much free money,” said the founder of Yardeni Research Inc. He predicts the S&amp;P 500 will finish the year at 4,300, about an 8% gain from current levels.

Still, it’s hard to ignore the risks to underlying assumptions. While rock-bottom rates underpin many of the arguments, this year has shown that the Fed still is willing to let longer-term interest rates run higher. And betting on huge upside earnings surprises is risky too -- it’s rare to see a 16% beat historically. Before last year, earnings had exceeded estimates by an average 3% a quarter since 2015.

“This happens in every bubble,” said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders. “It’s: ‘Don’t think about the traditional value metrics, we have a new one.’ It’s: ‘Imagine if everyone did XYZ, how big this company could be.’”

Returns of 2%

Valuations are never useful market-timing tools because expensive stocks can get more expensive, as was the case during the Internet bubble. Yet viewed through a long-term lens, valuations do matter. That is, the more over-valued the market is, the lower the future returns. According to a study by Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian, things like price-earnings ratios could explain 80% of the S&amp;P 500’s returns during the subsequent 10 years. The current valuation framework implies an increase of just 2% a year over the next decade, their model shows.

To Scott Knapp, chief market strategist of CUNA Mutual Group, abandoning standard valuation measures because the environment has changed places investors in “pretty sketchy territory.” Talk of watershed moments rendering traditional metric irrelevant is a signal, he says.

“That’s usually is an indication we’re trying to justify something,” he said."|investing|Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation Metrics One by One|76.0|0.79

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ieh7-xYxn0B\_5d7xYB\_VfoQC4r5aT8n7B\_b6BvmKl6c/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ieh7-xYxn0B_5d7xYB_VfoQC4r5aT8n7B_b6BvmKl6c/edit?usp=sharing)

Some key highlights: 

"" **Future of Palantir**

Palantir estimates that the total TAM in the consulting space is $119 billion with the commercial space worth $56 billion with over 6000 and the government space at $63 billion.  In the commercial space, the TAM is calculated by the total number of customers with 6,000 companies with over $500 million revenue and multiplied by the annual contract size (around $10 million a year). The government sector TAM includes government agencies that align with liberal democracies in which the U.S government accounts for $26 billion and international agencies for $37 billion and the federal and state expenditure.

We expect that in the next 10 years for Palantir to:

1. Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.
2. Palantir’s 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry. Furthermore, during COVID-19, Palantir partnered with hospitals and government organizations to help manage medical supply chains, analyze efficient medical practices, and maximize hospital efficiency in operations.
4. By utilizing Palantir, organizations are able to adapt to changing environments and the operating systems for the modern enterprise give insights into decisions into alpha, pathing into a future leader of the data analytics consulting space. 
5. The building and enabling of the software with connected institutions and companies allows for business software integration along with the vertical integration nature of Palantir’s infrastructure.
6. In addition, Palantir’s software creates organic growth and value for companies that allows for individual expansion with individual organizations to accommodate new users, workflows, and can rapidly scale to that of an institution.
7. Palantir to become the default operating system for data across the U.S government following the court ruling in [Palantir vs. U.S Army (2016)](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/), where the court ruled that the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and that the Army not conducted research into commercial products, Palantir’s Gotham technology, that was more efficient and cheaper than DCGS-A. Palantir was eventually awarded a ten year contract worth over $876 million over competitor Raytheon Technologies. The controversy was brought to Capitol Hill by Rep. (Republican) Duncan Hunter who voiced the desires of thousands of soldiers in the battlefield.
8. Become a leader in the commercial consulting space, following the increase in the sales force and spending in marketing which plays a major role in an expanding customer base.
9. In both Gotham and Foundry, the “Digital Twin” is effective in upgrading the product such as improving the weapons system and connecting its infrastructure with the company which not only make the company more efficient but better and more competitive. ""

1616903849.0|0.0|t3_meu01j|80.0|"Robert Shiller has discovered a backward looking metric, which he calls Excess CAPE Yield (ECY), that shows a correlation with future returns. He discusses it in a blog post ([https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11)), but doesn't go into that much detail.  He does share the underlying data on-line.

Essentially, ECY measures how desirable stocks are compared to bonds, in terms of expected yields. Larger numbers are better for stocks, and ECY, as of March 2021, is 3.02%. I set out to determine if 3.02% is a ""good"" number or not.

More specifically, ECY = 1/CAPE - (GS10 - inflation)

CAPE = Cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio = S&amp;P real price / (average real earnings from last ten years)

GS10 is the ten year US treasury yield.

Inflation is measured over the last ten years.

See [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing) \-&gt; Charts. The first figure shows ECY on the x-axis, and subsequent 10 year annualized excess return on the y-axis. Visually, there is a correlation that starts about 1915. The next two plots show the correlation more explicitly, first for 1881 - 2011, and then for 1915 - 2011. The second plot is cleaner.

I then did some back testing and experimenting, which is in the Data tab of the google doc. I found the highest return with the rule that stocks are more desirable if ECY from 3 months ago &gt; 2.0%.

If I move a maximum of 1/12th of my portfolio each month (turning over the whole portfolio in a year) I get an annualized return of 8.73% from 1915 to 2021, compared to 6.78% for stocks alone.

**Conclusions**

* In January, ECY was 3.77%, which is significantly greater than 2.0% so now is not the time to switch to bonds.
* It is rare to get a signal to switch to bonds, and the signal takes a long time to solidify, but that signal should not be ignored.

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* I used 10-year treasuries and the S&amp;P 500 as my benchmarks because they are both available all the way back to 1871, not because I think they are optimal investments."|investing|Bonds vs Stocks and Short Term Returns: Now is not the Time to Panic|80.0|0.93
1616902891.0|0.0|t3_metref|232.0|"A huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **&lt;2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **&gt;175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.
 
With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.

IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google)."|investing|[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla's|232.0|0.85

Tracking the global transition to electrification.

By The Numbers

* $137Average price, per kilowatt hours, for a lithium-ion battery pack in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* 112,000Public EV charging points installed in China, in December 2020; the monthly figure is more than the size of the entire U.S. public charging network (Source: BloombergNEF)

Why it Matters

At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, automakers’ electric ambitions seemed at risk. But the global auto industry is pushing ahead, driven by carbon emissions targets and climate change policies globally. Combined with the industry’s technological advances, those EV ambitions now are within close reach.

Bloomberg’s coverage of this transition is focused primarily on: cutting-edge technology (improving battery manufacturing processes as one example); cost competitiveness; performance (range, and an adequate charging infrastructure); and regulatory mandates.

There are now more than 10 million electric vehicles on the road globally — a small share of total sales, but a quickly growing one. As BloombergNEF’s analysts have underscored, and reporters from [Bloomberg Green](https://www.bloomberg.com/green?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) / [Hyperdrive](https://www.bloomberg.com/hyperdrive?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) have documented, there’s no turning back — the transition to electric road transport is inevitable."|investing|Plugging In: The EV Transition Gains Speed|553.0|0.96

Its  products and applications include  financial messaging, a virtual  patient support center that allows  doctors and staff to access sample  vouchers, co-pay coupons, and other  patient support through their EMR  and/or e-prescribe systems; and brand  awareness and therapeutic support  messaging services, such as brand  awareness messages, reminder ads,  therapeutic support messages, and  unbranded messages. The company also  offers brand support services,  which focuses on educating and working  with pharmaceutical manufacturers  on identifying, formulating, and  implementing new eRx media strategies,  including drug file integration,  sales force training, and strategy  development services for promoting  their products. In addition, it  operates cloud based Mobile Health  Messenger platform that provides  interactive health messaging for  enhanced medication adherence and care  coordination; and  HIPAA-compliant automated mobile messaging platform  that allows  pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly  engage  with patients to enhance regimen compliance. Further, the  company  offers patient programs with treatment and affordability  information,  lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device  connectivity, forms,  and surveys.

The most compelling  part of the company's business is there B2B platform. What do I mean  with this. So traditionally if e.g. a drug manufacturer like Pfizer or  JnJ develops a drug succesfully, that is only the first step. What makes  a new drug succesful is the distribution in the market, i.e. among the  actual doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, psychologists etc. Same goes with  new medical devices, e.g. by Thermo Fisher. After inventing and  developing them, they need to be rolled out by the respective company to  really cash in on this.

So  traditionally this was handled by agents. They were going to the  hospitals or pharmacies like WBA to offer them the company's products.  They were presenting the products using PowerPoint, buying them nice  lunch etc. to convince them of their new product. You can compare this  with an insurance agent who tries to find new customers for their  respective company to engage.

Well  this however, is no longer needed. OptimizeRX has developed a platform,  which allows companies to engage virtually with physicians, hospitals,  doctors, psychologists etc. to promote their product.

""When  a new treatment is available, it’s important to get the word out as  soon as possible so patients can benefit. The OptimizeRx platform is an  ideal communications network to accelerate awareness of a new brand or  to quickly spread the word during significant life-cycle events such as a  new indication. And with OptimizeRx, you can precisely target the  physicians, and their healthcare staff, that matter most. And you can  put your provider communications front and center in the EHR."" [(read here)](https://www.optimizerx.com/provider-engagement-applications)

I  always like to compare the company to Teladoc (TDOC). But while TDOC is  B2C (connects the buisness, i.e. hospital, doctor, psychologist etc.,  to the customer, i.e. patient). OPRX meanwhile approaches medical care  in a more B2B fashion, connecting the manufacturer of medical devices  and new drugs to the actual places where they get applied or sold  (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies etc.).

The  overall advantages should be clear, catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic  but to strengthen my point I want to give you some bullet points:

* While  it takes consumers/patients a change of habit to change from a analog  to a virtual platform which is always kind of connected to a certain  laziness (by human nature, we are a creature of habit who does not want  to change that quickly), businesses and enterprises are driven by hard  facts, i.e. time and money. So if there is a more cost effective way,  businesses will choose this way. And connecting virtually not only saves  money, it also saves time (remember, earlier the agent brought lunch  presenting his PowerPoint). No doctor has the time to do that.
* With  the OPRX platform the doctor/hospital/psychologist/pharmacist saves  time because he can find target-orientated solutions through the EHR.  Being more efficinet saves time. And saving time saves money.
* Health care is growing rapidly, more money will be spent on drug development. These drugs need to be promoted and sold.
* As far as I have found out there is no other (listed) company that provides a similar service.

**(2) Fundamentals, guidance and valuation**

OPRX  has a market cap of $797M as of writing this which makes it a small  cap. TTM revenue accounts for $43.3M which results in a P/S ratio of  18.4. Full year 2020 yoy rev growth was 76%, Q4 yoy rev growth was even  higher at 123%.

For the full year, operating income was a negative ($2,135M). Q4 operating income however was positive $1.356M.

So  what you can see overall, is that the metrics improved especially  lately. They increased revenue tremendously especially in Q4 with  posting positive operating income.

OPRX  didn't give explicit guidance. However, they set an aspirational goal  of $100M. But what really strikes me the most isn't the fact that they  will reach that, but how. Here's the part of the conference call  transcript:

*Analyst:  ""Okay, and then speaking of aspirations, I noticed you didn't give us a  year in which you're going to have $100 million in revenue. So we've  got a potential revenue of $100 million. I just wanted to dive into  that, you  have  talked  about  a  shift  to  more  subscription  type   revenue  or  current type revenue. In this  year where you do achieve  that $100 million in revenue, what percentage is subscription?""*

*William  Febbo (CEO): ""\[...\] Yes, we don't give guidance, so we don't put a date  on it. I think what's more important is we have the  team  to  get   there,  asidefrom  maybe  a  few  select  hires; so  that  should   scream,  we're  going  after  it hard. There's that leverage we keep  talking about""*

He also said: *""  In 2021, we expect to see a continued favorable shift to higher margin  recurring-revenue enterprise deals, and we believe our pipeline growth  has been driven by a permanent shift to more digital enablement.""*

So the key takeaway from this for me is that

(1) a large part of their revenue is recurring

(2) the recurring revenue is higher margin, which results in even more operating income

(3) their pipeline is really strong in 2021 [(see here)](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise)

(4)  they do not have to hire big time to leverage their platform. The  platform is there, now they can scale it which is cost efficient,  further increasing margins and operating income.

So overall they have strong numbers, they are scaling their business and there certainly is demand for their product.

However: A good company does not make it necessarily a good investment, if it's too expensive (even [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) was dead money for quite some time after the 01' crash).

So what I want to do is compare the valuation of OPRX to Teladoc (TDOC).

The  reason why I compare OPRX with TDOC specifically as mentioned above is  because both  are operating a virtual platform in healthcare, just on  different levels: while TDOC connects the doctor with the patient (B2C),  OPRX connects the manufacturer of medications, drugs, therapies,  medical devices etc  with the doctor/hospital/laboratory/pharmacies/etc  (B2B). Same thing, different level of operation.

So  TTM P/S ratio is 18.4 in comparison with Teladoc's $1.093B in revenue  on a market cap of $26.9B which results in a TTM P/S ratio of 24,6.

One  could argue that this valuation gap in favor of OPRX is because TDOC  grew their Q4 revenue 145% yoy while OPRX “only“ grew 123%.

However, there are several points mentioned above that make me pick OPRX over TDOC:

(1) OPRX is profitable, posting \~1.4 million in net income in Q4 alone while TDOC isn’t profitable

(2)  business model: connecting B2B is traditionally higher margin and more  recurring; also the argument I made above that companies will shift to  digital solutions quicker than ""humans"" when it is cost-saving while  humans still are kind of a creature of habit who prefer to go to the  doctor in person.

(3)  outlook  -&gt; OPRX (admittedly vaguely) guided for 100 million revenue which  would be up \~130%. TDOC guided for  \~2bn in revenue which would be up  only \~83%.

So basically OPRX has

* cheaper multiples
* positive net income (!)
* higher projected growth

**(3) Future outlook and entry possibility**

So  I hoped to shed some light on OPRX, their business and their  fudnamentals. I am highly convinced by the business model and honestly  when I realized how drug manufacturers and medical device companies  promoted their products before in comparison to OPRX's solution it was  kind of eye-opening and thoroughly logical for me as no doctor or head  of a hospital wants to waste his time with a PowerPoint of a sales  agent.

The business shifted into  the next gear of course driven by the pandemic. It was the initial  booster. But from the statemtents during their [conference call](https://investors.optimizerx.com/static-files/8336b73a-4fd7-4ead-a8c3-f081c8063e68) about a month ago as well as the [latest press release](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise) you can be quite optimistic about the future of their business even afer the pandemic ends in 2021.

I  know the stock is richly valued. Look at the entire market. It ran 500%  yoy which I cannot deny is a good argument against investing right now  especialy if you are risk-averse. And certainly it is a small cap stock  which includes higher risk. But the business itself is high margin, high  growing, profitable and from my perspective uniquely positioned to  profit from a continued shift to digital solutions in a huge total  addressable market.

It recently  pulled back from a high of $64 to around $47.50 which is 25% off the  high. Given the (for you hopefully insightful) facts mentioned above  that was enough for me to enter a rather big position in OPRX yesterday.  And what in the end makes the most sense to me is not particularly a  financial but more of a common sense thought: The actual users of  medical devices and drugs do not have time for a sales agent. Why not  integrate it into an all around immersive platform. That is what OPRX  does.

1616824950.0|0.0|t3_me7ymc|505.0|"With the Chinese Central Bank ending stimulus and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act going into effect we have seen a mass selloff of Chinese securities as of late. This selloff has affected almost all Chinese companies only sparing a few that are involved in NFT and Bitcoin plays. This week alone $BIDU is down 22%, $BABA is down 6%, TIGR is down 22%, and FUTU is down 16%. These companies have shown strong growth and some even had amazing Q4 for 2020 during a pandemic (FUTU had a 281.6% increase of total revenue YoY for Q4). Below I am going to explain the two main reasons I see this sell off happening and why I believe it gives a unique buying opportunity.

**· China Central Bank And Government Ending Pandemic Stimulus, Tighter Liquidity Market (1)(2)**

With China being the first major country to come out the other end of the pandemic the China Central Bank and government announced they will be ending the stimulus stance taken during the pandemic to prop up the economy. China is the first major country to emerge on the other side of the pandemic and has returned to normal even in places like Wuhan. With this returning to normal the china central bank has stopped stimulus measures as the worry of inflation creeps in causing stocks of Chinese companies to sink due to more restrictions on flow of money. Additionally, china has continued to crack down on credit use and ease lending worrying about high default rates and companies being over leveraged. This is one of the many reasons ANT was blocked (as well as internal country politics). While many would see this as a sign to be worried it is in fact quite the opposite. China is now positioned to grow rapidly while the rest of the world continues to be weigh down by Covid all the while doing its best to control inflation and risky lending ensuring a bright future for the Chinese economy. No longer having a need for stimulus is a bullish sign not a bearish and should be celebrated.

**· Risk Of Mass Chinese Delisting, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (3)(4)**

On Wednesday March 24th the SEC moved to enact the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) which requires foreign companies to allow regulators to review financial audits of overseas companies as well as requires companies to submit documents to prove they are not owned by a government entity and list any board members who are government officials. Anyone who has dabbled in foreign companies will know that the vast majority report unaudited results. Doing so going forward could mean ejection from the NYSE or Nasdaq. China itself restricts what information companies can provide to foreign auditors so even if a company wanted to abide by this new rule it may be difficult. Additionally, the Chinese government is heavily involved in many of the major corporations that operate within China. This spells potential doom for a fast majority of Chinese companies currently listed. To be clear I am 100% for financials being audited and I would love for this to be a thing. I think the fear of government influence in companies is overblown and the US itself heavily plays with the scales of companies that operate in the US, think the bail outs as well as tax breaks for major manufacturers (Boeing). I see all of this as sabre rattling by both sides and since this is a Trump law it is unlikely to continue as is without some tweaks under the Biden admin. It is very unlikely that the us government is just going to mass delist so many companies wiping out trillions in us dollars (big banks invest in these companies!) as the firesale happens before they are ejected from the exchanges. A likely compromise will be reached quietly and both sides will claim victory.

**TLDR:** Chinese dual listed and ADR stocks are taking a beating due to a new us law, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as well as China central bank and government ending pandemic stimulus. This has created a unique opportunity where many Chinese companies, ones with healthy books and set for expansion, are selling off. I believe the fear around US mass delisting Chinese companies is overblown and that the Chinese economy is set to continue its expansion in the coming years and that the end of stimulus was due. I see this as a great buying opportunity to get on great companies well below price. This sell off may continue for a few weeks but will come to a halt once the SEC law is changed / rescinded and good economic numbers come out of China. In the coming weeks I will be looking to expand my current holdings in TIGR, FINV, QD, and open new positions in FUTU, CLPS, BABA. Remember: “Be greedy when others are fearful” - Warren Buffett.

 In this post, we will go over the Best Canadian Index ETFs. I selected only highly popular ETFs with a minimum asset under management of 3 Billion dollars. First things first, we will go over some definition and the pro and cons of holding index ETFs. 

### What’s an Index ETF

There are several types of ETFs. And, index ETFs are the king of the hill. In fact, the first ever ETF introduced to a North American Exchange was an index ETF. Index ETFs offer exposure to a large number of securities and sometimes to a whole stock exchange at a very low cost. Their main goal is to acquire, on your behalf, all the securities that constitute a specific index in order to achieve the same return of the tracked index minus the fees.

### Does Index funds pay dividend?

Yes they do. Since Index ETFs holds all shares of companies part of the index, if these companies pay dividends then a dividend will be distributed. See below the performance table, the dividend yield is included.

 

### Popular indexes

#### S&amp;P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index)

includes over 200 top-ranked Canadian stocks, representing approximately 95% of the Canadian equity market. Constituent securities must pass minimum float-adjusted and liquidity screens to qualify and maintain membership in the Index. Index weights are capped at 10% of the Index’s float-adjusted market capitalization and are reviewed quarterly.

#### S&amp;P/TSX 60

An index constituted of the 60 largest companies in the Toronto Stock Exchange

#### FTSE Canada All Cap

The FTSE Canada All Cap Domestic Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index representing the performance of Canadian large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. As of Feb 28th, this index had 178 member stocks.

### Pro and cons of index investing?

**Pros:**

\-Low MER: Because Index ETFs are a passive style of investment, they do not require an active manager. This is why the cost to operate an Index ETF is cheaper than say an Actively managed ETF. Low MER means you will benefit more from the returns the funds makes;

\-Investing in a index fund has proven to be a great strategy in the long term (if you have more than 5 years horizon).

**Cons:**

\-Index ETFs are volatile since they are tied directly to the performance of a stock exchange. Exchanges tend to rally quickly on a glimpse of good economic news but also fall sharply when investors are pessimistic about the near term. This is why it’s important when you buy an index ETF to keep it for the long run and not short term.

\-Some investors prefer to have control over their investments and cherry pick stocks. Obviously, this is not possible under an index fund which basically holds all stocks part of the index without any pre-selection process.

 

### ETFs selected for the analysis

Now that we are done with the definitions, below are the Best Canadian Index ETFs list. We will focus in our comparison on the largest ETFs in Canada in terms of the Asset Under Management.

 Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – **VCN**                  0.99 

 Beta is a measure of risk in comparison to the market. The higher the Beta the higher the volatility 

 XIU has the lowest volatility among our 4 contenders. This is probably due the fact that its’ holdings are exclusively large Canadian companies. Large companies tend to be more stable than the overall market. The other ETFs have a beta of 1 which is not surprising since they track a more global market index. 

#  Ishares S&amp;P TSX 60 Index (XIU.TO)

iShares S&amp;P/TSX 60 Index ETF as its’ name implies, it’s a fund that is constituted with the 60 largest companies that are members of the TSX. It’s the most popular ETF in Canada with 10 Billion dollars in Assets. This ETF is representative of the Canadian economy which is dominated by the Energy and Financial sector as you can see below n the sector allocation table.

The number of holdings for the ETF is 60. It has the highest MER in the list but this did not really impact its long term performance in comparison with the other funds. For the 1 year performance, XIU recorded a slightly lower performance than the other ETFs.

# Ishares Core S&amp;P TSX Capped Comp (XIC.TO)

Seeks long-term capital growth by replicating the performance of the S&amp;P®/TSX® Capped Composite Index, net of expenses. While XIU has 60 holdings in total, XIC is much larger with 219 Canadian companies. In terms of performance both XIU and XIC are quite close. XIC has a lower MER 0.06% in comparison to XIU at 0.15%. XIC is dominated by Energy and Financial companies which is the same case for XIU.

#  BMO S&amp;P TSX Capped Comp (ZCN.TO)

ZCN is the third contender in this list of Best Index ETFs in Canada. The BMO S&amp;P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF (ZCN) has been designed to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the S&amp;P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index), net of expenses. Both ZCN and XIC are quite similar. They both track the S&amp;P/TSX Capped Composite index. XIC has a lower MER.

#  Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – VCN

Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap Index ETF seeks to track the performance of a broad Canadian equity index that measures the investment return of large-, mid- and small-capitalization, publicly traded securities in the Canadian market.

Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street's institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don't have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

""Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn't have before,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. ""It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.""

SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It's common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don't typically offer them to the everyday investor.

Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter's debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs. Firms like Goldman generate revenue from Wall Street funds, which often choose to get in on an IPO ""based on the access they get to that unique product,"" he said.

""Individual investors don't generate those types of revenues, therefore they don't get access to the unique product,"" Noto said. ""The cost of serving retail, if they did decide to do that, would be too high.""

SoFi clients who have at least $3,000 in account value will be able enter the amount of shares they want as a ""reservation."" The app will alert them when it's time to confirm an order."|investing|SoFi to give amateur investors early access to IPOs|1958.0|0.97

Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends

* **Big banks will be allowed to resume normal levels of dividend payouts and share repurchases as of June 30, as long as they pass this year’s stress test.**
* **Payouts had been restricted based on income, as a precautionary move during the Covid-19 pandemic.**
* **Banks that fail the stress test will have to wait until Sept. 30, and face even more stringent measures if they still don’t meet capital requirements by then.**

Banks will be able to accelerate dividends and buybacks to shareholders this year, but not until June 30 and provided they pass the current round of stress tests, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday.

The biggest Wall Street institutions have been limited based on income in their ability to do both for nearly the past year as a precautionary measure during [the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/covid-live-updates.html).

The Fed had said late last year that it would begin allowing regular disbursements in the first quarter of 2021, so the Thursday announcement pushes that date back.

“The banking system continues to be a source of strength and returning to our normal framework after this year’s stress test will preserve that strength,” Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.

Bank stocks rose in after-hours trading on the news, with Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase up around 1%.

Lifting the restrictions only applies to institutions that maintain proper capital levels as evaluated through the stress tests. Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.

The income-based measures [were put in place](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html) as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.

Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.

The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&amp;P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.

The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said [she would be comfortable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html) with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.

At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.

“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”

Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit."|investing|Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends|825.0|0.97

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a one-year low last week, providing a powerful boost to an economy on the verge of stronger growth as the public health situation improves and temperatures rise.

But the labor market is not out of the woods yet, with the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing a staggering 18.953 million people were still receiving unemployment checks in early March. It will likely take years for a full recovery from the pandemic’s scarring.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 97,000 to a seasonally adjusted 684,000 for the week ended March 20, the lowest since mid-March.

The run-up in cyclicals has been sharp in the past months but my investment thesis is that they still have much room to grow if macro-economists are right about record GDP growth rates for the US, inflation or no inflation.

Jefferies is one company that has rebounded very strongly from their pandemic lows, beating analyst expectations for 5 out of 5 quarters by delivering record earnings each time - and this includes Q1 2021 with the announcement just out yesterday.

When the news came up about the Fed removing capital requirement concessions given to banks due to Covid (in my mind, it likely meant lower earnings growth), I discarded most of my us banking stocks and was seriously considering taking profits on Jefferies too but I opted not to in the end because earnings were due soon and I had great confidence that they would not disappoint. That faith has since been repaid and I couldn't be happier 😄. I almost feel like putting more money into JEF but that would be violating my portfolio diversification rules.

Going forwards, I expect a gradual slowdown in growth rates (it would be incredible if they could keep up such immense rates of quarterly growth) but Jefferies still looks like a promising play that gets bolstered by the recovery and growth of the US economy.

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment."|investing|The SEC confirms it is investigating SoftBank for market manipulation.

1616616477.0|0.0|t3_mcfag2|206.0|"## Definition of preferred shares

When you own a share of a company. You are basically part of the business. You have the right to vote and participate in shareholders’ annual meeting. Your return will depend solely of the performance of the company in the stock market and its dividends. It’s rewarding but it’s also risky. Preferred shares are a bit different. You don’t get to vote and you have no ownership in the business. Your preferred share entitles you priority to dividends based on a percentage agreed upon in advance. The priority means the company needs to pay you first before paying the regular shareholders. In case of bankruptcy, you have first claim on the assets of the company. So, in essence, a preferred share is kind of hybrid product that shares certain characteristics of bonds (a bit of safety) and some of regular shares (potential for appreciation).

Investors can invest directly in preferred shares as they trade like stocks. Or, they can buy preferred shares ETF to achieve diversification and reduce risk.

A preferred share grants the holder a percentage return based on its par value. there are several risks associated with preferred shares:

* The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;
*  It's possible for preferred stocks to appreciate in market value based on positive company valuation, although this is a less common result than with commons stocks;
* Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;
* An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime. Only 'Callable' Pref shares can be recalled by the issuer.

## What’s a preferred shares ETF

It’s basically ETFs that invest mainly in preferred shares. These ETFs are quite popular because they offer investors interesting yields with possibility of capital appreciation. Among all fixed income products, there’s no question that preferred shares usually offer the best return in comparison to bonds. This being said a preferred share carries more risk than owning a bond.

## [Methodology](https://wyzeinvestors.com/?p=708#Methodology)

I started by selecting all Fixed income ETFs offered in Canada. I considered in my comparison only ETFs that pay more than 3% dividend yield. I consider 3% a reasonable payout especially if it’s combined with an interesting capital appreciation. Most fixed income ETFs holders seek a regular dividend income. So, it’s an important condition.

Second step: I ranked these ETFs based on the past 52 weeks performance.

Third step: All ETFs in the list should have asset under management above 100 M. Generally speaking, the higher the AUM the better the liquidity because of the high volume of shares exchanging hands daily. This factor is important because investors should be able to buy and sell an ETF at a reasonable spread. The spread is the difference between the bid and the ask price. For liquid assets, the spread can be as little as 0.005$ while for low AUM ETFs the spread can easily reach 0.05$. If you buy 100 shares that’s 5$ cost in addition to the commission you’re paying to the broker.

It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining
* Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.

&amp;#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&amp;D costs.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

This is the [prospectus](http://direxioninvestments.onlineprospectus.net/DirexionInvestments//SPXL/index.html?open=Summary%20Prospectus) I'm looking at. Turn to page 380 for the section I'm trying to understand.

From my understanding it is trying to explain how without rebalancing, you become overexposed if the underlying asset depreciates and underexposed when the asset appreciates.

I thought that the math basically worked as such: In the ideal situation you buy the fund and at that instant your asset is valued at (3/1=) 300% of the underlying index. If the underlying asset drops by 1% then  (3/.99=) 303% but the provided table states an index move of -1% = 306%.  Conversely, if the index appreciates then you become underexposed as such (3/1.01=) 297%, but again the table states it as 294%.  

This seems to point to being off by a factor of two as 3/.98 = 306% and 3/1.02 = 294%. If I am off by the factor of two then I don't fully understand the math behind the calculation. Also the factor of 2 math falls apart with the larger price moves: 3/.9 = 333% (not the provided 335% in the table) and 3/1.1 = 272% (not the provided figure of 274%).

To further complicate things the table for the exposure of a Leveraged Bull Fund and Leveraged Bear Fund are different and I'm not seeing why. 

If someone can explain to me the math in both the Bear and Bull scenarios used to come up with the data in the table I'd appreciate it.

[March 4]    
&gt;Japanese funds sold a **record $34 billion of foreign bonds in the two weeks ended Feb. 26** as the nation’s fiscal year-end [on 31] March approaches — enough to cause reverberations in U.S. repurchase markets for 10-year Treasuries.
&gt;
What started out as a **re-balancing of books by Japanese funds** has added to the volatility in global markets, with Treasury yields rocketing to levels seen before the pandemic, as a vicious cycle unfolds as selling begets more sales. The dumping from Japan, one of the biggest owners of debt, triggers hedging by dealers on the other side of the trade, which in turn impacts crucial funding markets relying on bonds as collateral.  
  
***  
And from ""some other website that everyone loves to hate"" [March 24]:  
&gt;....observation was made this week by Morgan Stanley's chief rates strategist Matthew Hornbach, who over the weekend identified the origin, if not quite the identity, of the persistent seller of Treasurys over the past few months, who has sparked such a violent rout across not just the US rates space but also stocks and other core assets.
&gt;
As the following remarkable chart from Hornbach makes very clear, the cumulative downward price movement in Treasury futures has been concentrated in the Tokyo session. Furthermore, after a brief respite in the first week of March, selling in the Tokyo session accelerated dramatically ahead of the FOMC meeting and it continued afterward.  
&gt; 
Of course, the initial burst of Treasury futures selling - which appears to have originated out of Japan every time - would then have a domino effect on the rest of the world, and as Morgan Stanley notes, ""weak price action during the Tokyo session led to additional selling during the London session"" although to a lesser extent. As the next chart shows, since the start of the year, 85% of the cumulative decline in TY futures prices occurred in the overnight session, i.e., Japan is almost single-handedly responsible for the dump surge in yields this year!  
&gt; 
Why does this matter? Because if Morgan Stanley is right, and if the seemingly daily Treasury selling indeed originates out of Tokyo, there is finally good news for bond bulls: Hornbach writes that ""we have good reason to believe the selling from Japan won't last... into April."" That's because the fiscal year in Japan ends on March 31. ""At that point, liquidation of non-yen bond holdings should stop, if not reverse at some point in the April-June quarter."""|investing|It appears the recent move in the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.2% to 1.7% had very little to do with inflation expectations.|543.0|0.96

-	Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

-	The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

-	The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology, a major manufacturer of semiconductors, and the leading provider of silicon globally,” Gelsinger said.

Intel also said that it will act as a “foundry,” or a manufacturing partner, for other chip companies that focus on semiconductor design but need a company to actually make the chips. Intel said its foundry subsidiary will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.

Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.

A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business.

The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.

Wall Street is not thrilled.

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research &amp; Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&amp;#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&amp;#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|&lt;30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|&lt;7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|&lt;7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|&lt;30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\&gt;25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

**Edit:** Hey guys, thanks for all the support. I thought I'd clarify a couple of things and revise some of my statements. First of all, I was totally wrong about Xbox. Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office. I was talking about GS taking market share from Office Consumer NOT Office Commercial. I feel as if many regular people are willing to trade computational power in exchange for not having to pay. As far as I'm concerned, Office Commercial has a mile-long moat with crocodiles in it."|investing|Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mine|1802.0|0.95

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&amp;#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at its current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&amp;#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering its growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

With this somewhat traumatic memory in my mind I was curious to know exactly how much of my assets(stocks) that are sitting in my TD Ameritrade account are insured in one way or another. Here's what I found:

1) Cash 'may' be covered by the FDIC up to 250k. The language on this was a little opaque so I'd call them to confirm if I wanted to know for sure. 

2) CDs purchased through TD are covered by the FDIC.

3) Securities are covered by the SIPC up to 500k.

4) TD has a supplemental insurance policy that claims to protect customers up to 149.5 million for securities and 2 million for cash. The big caveat here is the aggregate limit for this policy is a measly 500 million.

This won't be an issue for most people (myself included) but I thought it was interesting to see how the 12 million customers with 1.2 trillion worth of assets at TD are insured in the worst case scenario. It seems like those with over 500k in assets with TD might be exposed given some crazy event that leads to insolvency. 

I don't think insolvency is going to happen, but its worth knowing your exposure.

In looking for ways in which to invest in the growing economy of south-saharan Africa, Nigeria in particular (Yes haha, but no royal families were involved in the writing of this post), I came across several crowd investing platforms as possibly the best way to do so, as a westerner with limited funds.

The idea is always similar: Invest (with others) into a specific project where a farmer needs land/equipment/seeds/whatever to get started (or to improve), but can't get a bank loan, then share the profit of the harvest with the farmer (variable ROI depending on harvest, typically around 10% in 6-12 months).

I particularly like the idea of helping someone at the same time as investing and there's definitely an altruistic side to this. Often the projects involve providing jobs to unemployed youth, and/or would significantly improve the future outlooks of the supported farmer(s).

Unfortunately, I can't find much further information on the web about any of these sites, but at least I didn't find any scam accusations while searching for people's experiences. 

My biggest concerns are:

- What if the project (platform) I choose turns out to be an outright scam?

- What if I choose a long term project and the platform goes belly up/bankrupt? (Following some recommended links in an article I found, half of the linked sites didn't exist anymore. Yikes.)

- How will I have any realistic legal recourse if I don't even live on the same continent as the platform owners?

With every investment, there is risk, and I'm inclined to give some of them a shot with a small amount, because I really like the concept a lot. But first, I wanted to see if any of you have any experience with any of the following sites:

- https://ez-farming.com - this one is simultaneously the most appealing to me, and the most concerning because much of the website is broken or unfinished.

others:

- https://kwidex.com/

- https://www.youfarm.africa

- https://www.farmfundr.com - This one is in the US, so more trustworthy, but lacking that altruism factor a bit.

- https://charmimpact.com - Not farming, but bringing CO2 reduction and energy efficient tech to rural areas, helping them save money, so upping profits.

1616435520.0|0.0|t3_matlli|55.0|"Hello everyone, I would like to share my thoughts on the lumber market for the next 4-6 months and an ETF that could benefit heavily (WOOD). 

Why WOOD? 

* Exposure to companies that produce forest products, agricultural products, and paper and packaging products.
* Targeted access to timber &amp; forestry stocks from around the world
* Use to express a global sector view
* Directly affected by lumber futures

Why not lumber futures? 

* Lumber futures have never attracted the level of volume and OI for a successful futures contract. I have traded various futures ranging from agricultural to energy and lumber is a nightmare for liquidity. You'd buy and be stuck in your position essentially so opening a position in the WOOD ETF is a much safer bet. 

Now that we have the ""Whys"" out of the way, let's get into a brief discussion on lumber markets. 

* \[New record highs for wood futures\] ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs))
* The housing market reflects optimism on rates
   * The US Housing Market has been booming despite the high level of unemployment and economic contraction from COVID. However, the pandemic is changing trends in where people are choosing to live (Zoom Towns). As the work environment has changed to remote and people are leaving urban areas, we are seeing a demand spike for new homes which is increasing the requirements for wood. 
   * Record low interest rates are providing support for new construction and existing homes. We also know that Jerome ""Print Money, Honey"" Powell is taking us into the low interest rate promise land until 2023. 
* Home Improvement and Mill Closures
   * Obviously people are spending more time on projects at home given they are at home more often these days. Sales at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) have pushed both companies to record highs in late 2020. This trend will continue into the Spring as people look to add onto their homes outside with the better weather.
   * Lumber mills across the country, and even Canada, have closed down or limited production of wood products since Q42020. Increased demand and very low supply levels have created a perfect storm for bullish lumber futures. 
* Market Sentiment
   * Admittedly, I am going to be in this play because I am a direct end user of pallets. I am constantly being updated, sometimes daily but definitely weekly, on the price of lumber. Some of the quotes from the supplier are as follows:
      * ""We are going to get to a point where it's not about the price we/you are going to have to pay, it's going to be about can we even buy it - regardless of the price we/you have to pay."" - March 5, 2021
      * ""White hot demand and nothing to buy. It's not a matter of price at this point. The market is a runaway freight train. Not much else I can say"" - March 12, 2021
      * ""Wish we had better news to deliver but this market is something no one has seen before. My opinion is we will see prices in this range for 90 days, AT LEAST"" - March 21, 2021
      * ""At this point, would plan on this tight supply and high pricing to stand for at least 90 days as I see little hope for relief and demand is extremely strong. Where is additional supply even going to come from?? Very concerned"" - March 22, 2021

Continued Catalysts for Lumber Futures

* Agricultural season is starting up in California which will push demand up even more. California accounts for almost 14% of cash receipts in the US for agriculture. They have a LOT of demand for lumber via pallets. 
* Mills continue to struggle with inventory levels on tight supply. Given that a good portion of mills have closed down with no plans to reopen until COVID is settled, I continue to see issues on the supply side.
* Mills have strong order files through end of April and feel little pressure to discount prices at this point. Current pricing makes it difficult to ""stock up"" on inventory due to credit restraints so it's forcing people to continue to step in on a weekly basis to cover their needs as orders/business comes their way. This keeps buyers going back to the mills to purchase which enables mills to hold their price as material continues to be gobbled up. It's a VICIOUS cycle. 
* Improved weather will cause more people to purchase lumber as they begin Spring/Summer projects.
* Infrastructure rebuilding under Biden Administration. 

Bearish Case:

* My primary bear case is based on the rollout of COVID vaccines which would allow for a return to a more normal lifestyle. The vaccine could lead to a slowdown in housing construction and demand. Those who have been vaccinated could move or stay in cities where steel is the dominant choice for construction. 
* US &amp; Canadian Mills that have shutdown due to COVID start to come online which would add a large supply to the market. This would completely kill my thesis.   

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I would have taken a position back in November 2020 when the writing was on the wall but I think there is still juice left to squeeze based on market conditions. Potential upside would be \~30% over the course of 4-6 months. It could go higher but that is a conservative estimate.

1616427887.0|0.0|t3_maqmx6|1297.0|"Article from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

There have been multiple discussions of the pros/cons of long term DCA investments in IWDA vs. VTI.

Typical pros of IWDA:

1. No estate tax for non-US residents (unlike VTI which has 40% estate tax on the portfolio)
2. Does not pay dividends and is domiciled based - No dividends tax for non-US residents.
3. Worlds holdings and hence more diversified (as opposed to VTI which is US-centric) on paper - I mention ""on-paper"" since &gt;60% of IWDA holdings are based in US.

Pros of VTI:

1. Lower expense ratio of 0.03% (versus 0.20% for IWDA)
2. Pays dividends (if you need to have regular cash inflows)
3. Appears to pay more in the long term.

I begin to wonder (a) how much (if any) would the gains be like if one invests monthly via a dollar cost averaging strategy, and (b) if the gains are statistically significant. Here's the analysis and the results.

Data: Past 5-years monthly open and close prices for both stocks.

Assumptions: Fixed monthly investment (at the start of each month). No withdrawal. Ignore all dividends gains (agreed that this over-penalized VTI ).

Test: One tailed paired t-test.

Results:

1. Statistically speaking, month-on-month portfolio when investing via DCA on VTI is much more than IWDA - the p-value is &lt; 0.0136.
2. The results of \[1\] above is skewed towards **recent surge** in US stocks. Here's visualization of what I mean \[[https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG](https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG)\] - negative values indicate VTI to give stronger overall DCA returns where we can see increase gains starting in mid 2019.

On \[2\], I re-ran the t-test by breaking into 2 time windows, where I used 30 monthly data points

1. From 2016-2018: the p-value is non significant \[p &lt;= 0.44612\].
2. From mid2018-2021: the p-value is significant \[p&lt;= 0.01146\]

From the above, I can see the followings:

1. VTI provides better returns than IWDA, and the better performance is statistically significant.
2. VTI stronger performance is from \*recent\* trends - which is important since all things equal, modeling future performance from recent events is likely to be more correct than modelling from long-ago events.
3. VTI give dividends, which I ignored in this analysis. Including that would show VTI to be a more superior investment.

I'm super inclined to divert /pivot my portfolio (which is on IWDA now) to VTI at least for the next 5 years, since I don't see dominance of US companies declining any time soon. Will re-evaluate again post 5 years.

Would love to hear your feedback on the above."|investing|Analysis of IWDA and VTI investment using DCA over 5 year period|9.0|0.65

**Financials:**

The last earnings posted by Bionano was on the 13th of November, 2020. The consensus was ($0.06) and the reported ($0.08). They will report their Q4 financials for 2020 this Tuesday after the market close. The Consensus Estimate is ($0.05) and **in my opinion, there will be a surprise considering 2021 has been a breakthrough year for them.**

&amp;#x200B;

**PUT / CALL Ratio:**

Bionano currently has 0.49 put/call ratio which denotes a bullish sentiment that over the months and years becomes more and more bullish.

**Share Statistics:**

&amp;#x200B;

If we focus on the **short ratio** we can be calm that shorts are not betting against this company to fall.

We do see a very low percentage of shares owned by Insiders and Institutions. On the 25th of January, 2021, their CFO Christopher Stewart bought 64,500 shares. Insider buying is generally a positive prognostic and beneficial for the stock's price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the stock price rises. This might be the start of some Insiders movements in my opinion.

Moving onto Institutional ownership, Vanguard Group Inc., bought over 7.1 million shares at the end of 2020. They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.

&amp;#x200B;

**Competitors:**

&amp;#x200B;

The main three competitors are Fulgent Genetics Inc. ($FLGT), Twist Bioscience Corp. ($TWST), and NeoGenomics Inc. ($NEO).

Comparing their prices the lowest is after BNGO is NEO with 50.18 per share, FLGT at 105.96 per share, and TWST sitting at 130.29 per share.

Price aside, let's talk about **Bionano's Saphyr** characteristics that can put them above their competition.

\- Bionano’s Saphyr system is a research use-only platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics.

\- Bionano provides genome analysis services to provide access to data generated by the Saphyr system for researchers who prefer not to adopt the Saphyr system in their labs.

\- A publication of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) revealing that their sequencing method based on PacBio HiFi reads detected only 72% of the large SVs that Bionano’s optical genome mapping (OGM) detected across 32 different human genomes. The consortium developed its custom sequencing method by combining sequencing with PacBio and the single-strand prep and sequencing method StrandSeq to establish a comprehensive catalog of human SVs with base-pair and haplotype resolution. The cost of this method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. **OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method.**

\- With the latest update to Saphyr’s software released this week, the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week. For cases requiring higher coverage, like mosaic samples or heterogeneous tumors, the run can be extended up to 24 hours to collect as much as 400x coverage of a human genome for each of the three flowcells.

\- Per Erik Holmlin “By contrast, Saphyr images molecules that are consistently **20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads**. Sequencing reads are not getting longer, which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in the disease.”

\- Saphyr Chip Clip protects sample integrity and eliminates the need for instrument wash cycles between runs. Requires less than 3 minutes hands-on instrument time per chip. Automatic optimization of run conditions based on sample characteristics maximizes throughput.

\- The Bionano Prep DLS DNA labeling kit provides all the enzymes, dyes, and buffers you need to label non-amplified DNA for Saphyr. Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.

[*https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/*](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/)

\- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.

**Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.**

Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.

The company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.

All in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.

**Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.**

Bionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.

The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.

**TLDR &amp; My plan:**

I´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.

This is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.

So far I've read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I'm ***not*** a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I'm content with that ... mostly. 

I often read people commenting ""X is undervalued"" or ""Y is overvalued"" and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I've researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I've read so far has suggested that if there were a way to ""beat the market"" with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. 

So I'm left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they're not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on ""valuation"". 

Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?"|investing|"Personal investor ""Valuation"" vs. Index funds"|70.0|0.85

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

* Fidelity: Does not receive payment for order flow
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Does not receive payment for order flow
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.07 / 100 shares of stock

1616266670.0|0.0|t3_m9dmdf|82.0|"Financial Market Pessimism

I have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons below. Please change my mind.

1. US stocks are expensive. This means they are expected to have lower returns going forward. International stocks look like a better value, but their correlation with US equities has been increasing and may not offer the same diversification benefit they once had. Time will tell on this aspect.

2. The US stock market is being propped up by the largest sustained quantitative easing effort ever. If the FED steps off the gas just a little (by raising rates a tiny fraction of a percent) the market will lose its pacifier and become unstable. Look at all the volatility being blamed on increasing bond yields lately. Just imagine if rates are actually raised 25 basis points sometime in the next few years. 

3. The FED is about out of ammunition if another economic disaster hits. If the economy is bad, the FED cuts rates. Rates are at historic lows, and the economy is recovering. If we get hit with another recession and rates haven’t been increased, what is the FED going to do? Take them negative? That would be a disaster for anyone holding cash or people who are in late stage retirement at the time. It penalizes saving and incentivizes spending. That’s not something people like to do during a recession. Better start printing more checks or buying up assets (smh).

4. Bond yields are too low to bother with right now, and it is reasonable to expect them to climb as they have been doing. Who wants to buy bonds with a low yield with the expectation that the yield will increase? No one. Suppose yields fall, you may make some gains with price appreciation, but the yield is still awful! 

5. Housing prices have soared very quickly. Sure rates are good, but the market is getting expensive and rent collection will still be difficult for many people.

6. Digital monetary forms of exchange cannot be reasonably valued and is pure speculation. Maybe they’ll do well, maybe not. And which ones? It’s not a sure fire thing and should be seen as gambling / speculation and not investing.

7. Precious metals seem to do best when the economy is a dumpster fire. Once the recovery begins and things settle down, they start to lose value as money moves back into stocks. They seem best as a hedge against economic surprises, but not a good asset to just buy and hold long term.

8. Oil and natural gas prices can be easily manipulated by governments and should be avoided.

9. High yield savings accounts and money markets yield next to nothing today but it’s still the safest place to park your money. Inflation will eat away at it over time though but it’s less than watching it all evaporate if a risky investment doesn’t pan out well.

In sum, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and digital monetary forms of exchange all have glaring issues to me without much positive going for them. Am I wrong? I’m not the most well versed with the world of investing, but from a rudimentary perspective, it doesn’t look good. You take out low interest rates and the stimulus and you’ll see how fragile this market is. 

Despite my concerns, I’m still buying shares in VTWAX every month because that’s my plan, and I’m staying with it."|investing|Financial Market Pessimism|82.0|0.78

# Overview

For anyone who has seen me post on here, they'll realize I've long been following China's economy. Why? Because it's the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of \*potential\* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.

I'm not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.

**Why This is Important for Currency Markets &amp; The RMB**

If you watch this, you'll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.

If you don't want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.

In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the ""there is no alternative"" effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets."|investing|Understanding China's economy &amp; the embedded risks: This video has a surprisingly balanced and good take describing a lot of the risks and drivers of the Chinese economy.|73.0|0.85

However, I DO NO think there will be any significant additional expenditure by those unable to spend right now.

There will be a DISPLACEMENT of spending, but not much of an overall increase. Certainly not enough to move the needle with the official inflation calculations.


Now, some context and clarification.

I think I broadly disagree with the general literature being flagged around ""unavoidable inflation"" in the coming months.

Specifically, I am saying that I expect there to be a displacement of inflation from some segments of the economy to others. I DO NOT expect an overall increase in inflation by any significant amount.

Among other reasons why I think this will happen:

1) People keep making statements such as ""economy fully opening up and people with pent up demand unleashing it"". There seems to be a base assumption that MORE people will spend MORE money, MORE of the time.

As I see it, this assumption is mistaken. There are still approx 9.6 million people unemployed (as JPow said, looking at unemployment numbers as continuing claims + labor participation rate drop).

Even a generous estimation of how many 10s of millions are unable to spend due to this 9.6 million unemployed will likely undercount to impacted number of people.

In other words, the K shaped recovery will continue. The poorer sections of the economy have not been saving up large chunks, despite what you might see in terms of overall bank customer savings numbers. Them getting back to their jobs will have some impact on demand for regular offline retail and some improvement in their overall finances, but not enough to move the needle towards significant inflation.

Now as to why I think the economically weaker sections are unlikely to increase their spending much:

While they were much more financially impacted by the lockdowns, a part of their unavoidable financial spending was cushioned by a combination of rent and loan moratoriums, as well as stimulus payments. So while they might get back to their jobs and have a slightly higher spending pool available, their financial requirements will increase as well.

So they increase their spending on rent and travel, but at the same time, the govt' reduces and closes down programs of emergency rent assistance and addiotional stimulus payments become less likely. So overall the total spending in the economy is increased by a much smaller proportion than expected.

Keep in as well the fact that a section of society that has so suddenly and cruely been financially impacted by a unexpected pandemic, will have atleast some lasting ptsd related to it, and are much less likely to go on a spending binge unlike their more well off counter parts."|investing|"Inflationistas triggered by official CPI/PPI numbers not reflecting the inflation they see around them, are going to completely lose their minds when a few months from now, after every ""outing/entertainment"" venue is back to full capacity, the CPI/PPI still reflects as trending towards stagnancy."|45.0|0.78

1616217239.0|0.0|t3_m907q1|37.0|"The Federal Reserve said on Friday that it would not extend a temporary exemption of a rule that dictates the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve, a loss for big banks and their lobbyists, who had been pushing to extend the relief beyond its March 31 expiration.

At the same time, the Fed opened the door to future tweaks to the regulation if changes are deemed necessary to keeping essential markets functioning smoothly. Banks are required to keep easy-to-access money on hand based on the size of their assets, a requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio, the design of which they have long opposed.

The Fed introduced the regulatory change last year. It has allowed banks to exclude both their holdings of Treasury securities and their reserves — which are deposits at the Fed — when calculating the leverage ratio.

The goal of the change was to make it easier for the financial institutions to absorb government bonds and reserves and still continue lending. Otherwise, banks might have stopped such activities to avoid increasing their assets and hitting the leverage cap, which would mean having to raise capital — a move that would be costly for them. But it also lowered bank capital requirements, which drew criticism.
As a result, the debate over whether to extend the exemptions was a heated one.

Bank lobbyists and some market analysts argued that the Fed needed to keep the exemption in place to prevent banks from pulling back from lending and their critical role as both buyers and sellers of government bonds. But lawmakers and researchers who favor stricter bank oversight argued that the exemption would chip away at the protective cash buffer that banks had built up in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving them less prepared to handle shocks.

The Fed took a middle road: It ended the exemption but opened the door to future changes to how the leverage ratio is calibrated. The goal is to keep capital levels stable, but also to make sure that growth in government securities and reserves on bank balance sheets — a natural side effect of government spending and the Fed’s own policies — does not prod banks to pull back.

“Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the S.L.R. over time,” the Fed said in its release. It added that the goal would be “to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability.”

The Fed said it would “shortly seek comment” on measures to adjust the leverage ratio and would make sure that any changes “do not erode” bank capital requirements.

“The devil’s going to be in the details,” said Jeremy Kress, a former Fed regulator who teaches at the University of Michigan. “I want to make sure any changes the Fed makes to the supplementary leverage ratio doesn’t undermine the overall strength of bank capital requirements.”

The temporary exemption had cut banks’ required capital by an estimated $76 billion at the holding company level, although in practice other regulatory requirements lessened that impact. Critics had warned that lowering bank capital requirements could leave the financial system more vulnerable.

That is why the Fed was adamant in April, when it introduced the exemption, that the change would not be permanent.

“We gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily — it’s temporary relief — by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the leverage ratio,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a July 2020 news conference. He noted that “many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.”

Other banking regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, took longer to sign on to the Fed’s exemption, but eventually did.

Even though the exemption had been a tough sell in the first place, persistent worries over Treasury market functioning had raised the possibility that the Fed might keep it in place.

The government has been issuing huge amounts of debt to fund pandemic relief packages, pumping Treasury bonds into the market. At the same time, reserves are exploding as the Fed buys bonds and the Treasury Department spends down a cash pile it amassed last year. The combination risks filling up bank balance sheets. The fear is that banks will pull back as a result.

That’s because the supplementary leverage ratio measures a bank’s capital — the money it can most easily tap to make through times of trouble — against what regulators call its “leverage exposure.” That measure counts both its on-balance sheet assets, like Treasurys, and exposures that do not appear on a bank’s balance sheet but may generate income.
If banks fail to keep capital on hand that matches with their assets, they are restricted from making payouts to shareholders and handing executives optional bonuses.

Banks desperately want to avoid crossing that line. So if there is any danger that they might breach it, they stop taking on assets to make sure that they stay within their boundaries — which can mean that they stop making loans or taking deposits, which count on their balance sheets as “assets.”

Alternatively, banks can pay out less capital to make sure their ratio stays in line. That means smaller dividends or fewer share buybacks, both of which bolster bank stock prices and, in the process, pay for their executives.

The Financial Services Forum, which represents the chief executives of the largest banks, has argued that the temporary exemption should be rolled off more slowly and not end abruptly on March 31. Representatives from the group have been lobbying lawmakers on the issue over the past year, based on federal disclosures. And the trade group — along with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — sent a letter to Fed officials asking for the exemptions to be extended.

“Allowing the temporary modification to leverage requirements to expire all at once is problematic and risks undermining the goals that the temporary modification are intended to achieve,” Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the forum, wrote in a post this year.

Some banks have themselves pushed for officials to extend the exemption.

“This adjustment for cash and Treasury should either be made permanent or, at a minimum, be extended,” Jennifer A. Piepszak, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call.

Ms. Piepszak added that if the exemption for reserves was not extended, the supplementary leverage ratio would become binding and “impact the pace of capital return.” She has separately warned that the bank might have to turn away deposits.
Prominent Democrats have had little patience for such arguments.

“To the extent there are concerns about banks’ ability to accept customer deposits and absorb reserves due to leverage requirements, regulators should suspend bank capital distributions,” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, both powerful Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to Fed leadership.

Banks and their lobbying groups had little to say about the Fed’s move to kill the exemption. The eight largest banks have enough capital to cover their leverage ratios.

“A few weeks ago, it seemed like the consensus was that they would do an extension,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. He added that the Fed’s thinking might have been: “The banks were in solid enough shape to absorb this,  they were going to have to end this some time, and this seemed like a good time to do it.”

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers. 

**Disclaimer:**

Until now, I've been somewhat new to the details of investing, and am still getting to grips with fundamental and technical jargon, but am doing my best to provide information accurately. I'll provide links to their relevant LSE pages, as well as financial reports, to do a lot of the heavy lifting for me. The numbers I provide are coming from my broker and might be slightly different. If I have anything misleading or wrong, please let me know.

[Games workshop annual reports and half-year results](https://investor.games-workshop.com/annual-reports-and-half-year-results/) 

Possibly the best-known company on this list, it is an established company that has well-recognized IP. They own ""Warhammer"" and ""Warhammer 40,000"" along with their spin-offs, the more recent ""Age of Sigmar"", as well as a ""Lord of the Rings"" range that is still in production. To add to those, they also own brands such as ""Citadel"" (not to be confused with the hedge-fund), ""Black Library"", and ""Forge World"". They have a diverse range of products, from their core table-top wargame minis, to literature, a large number of licensed computer games, and even a number of TV shows in development. The most prominent of these shows is a live-action adaption of their ""Eisenhorn"" book series, with [Frank Spotnitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Spotnitz) as the showrunner. They also have lesser known [Funko figures](https://www.popinabox.co.uk/franchise/warhammer.list) and even [action figures](https://mcfarlane.com/toys/brands/warhammer/) that have been released, the latter of which was unexpectedly popular. 

In recent years the company has undergone a change in direction which has led to a rapid growth in share value, with approximately 80%/year growth for the past 5 years. More recently, they have seen a somewhat slow but consistent drop in share value over the past 3-4 months. Going forward, they are working to tap into Chinese markets which could potentially fuel a lot of further growth. This will likely be supported by a re-release of their ""Warhammer Fantasy"" range, notably with the inclusion of ""Kislev"" and ""Grand Cathay:"" Fantasy versions of Russia and China Respectively.

Brewdog are a craft brewing company that has exploded in popularity over the past decade. They are a famous brand, although many might not recognise it by name. Early in their history, in 2009, they gained worldwide infamy for the strongest beer at the time: Tactical Nuclear Penguin, which also almost ruined the company after regulators accused them of promoting irresponsible drinking. Over the years the company has continued to provoke controversy, although this has largely helped increase brand awareness rather than cause harm. As well as brewing, they operate a number of bars globally, and Brewdog also began to operate a small number of hotels pre-COVID.

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

**The narrative**

1. Chinese   energy production by source: Coal 58% Petro 20% Hydro 8% LNG 8%   Renewable 5%  Nuclear 2%. Renewables have had an amazing 10 years with   explosive growth, Liquids and Nuclear growth is more modest but Nuclear   curve is steeper. The general consensus is that renewables have a cap   due to commodity pricing. Also production is volatile and cannot serve   as the backbone without significant energy storage (again commodity   pricing affecting a great deal)[General reference](https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/CHN) and [deep dive](https://cnpp.iaea.org/countryprofiles/China/China.htm)
2. Emissions  targets for China: Increase and peak at 2030 and net 0 by  2060.Personally,  I find these targets unachievable, but if China meets  them, that will  not be the only miracle they've achieved in the past  100 years.Some background [here](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/blogs/energy-transition/121020-china-zero-carbon-target-2060-emissions-fossil-fuels)
3. There's  broad acceptance of nuclear power and social push for it's adoption.  This is mainly fueled by a generation of urban Chinese citizens  experiencing the explosive growth and pollution that comes with (similar  to 19th century Europe) check this [here](https://www.163.com/dy/article/G4Q5UPCP0538IN0P.html)
4. Technology:  No references here but I'd like to mention that technological  disruptions in more efficient energy storage and renewables are a  macro-threat to nuclear's market share. However the biggest disruptor  for the Uranium market would be a more efficient method of enrichment.

**The fundamentals**

1. CNNC  is the main vehicle for the Nuclear business end to end in China and  their only Nuclear technology export vehicle ""CNNC has  a complete  nuclear technology industrial system, including natural  uranium  exploration and mining, nuclear fuel manufacturing, nuclear  power  technology research and development, engineering design and   construction, equipment manufacturing, as well as the entire nuclear   fuel cycle and back-end radioactive waste treatment and disposal. "" full  article [here](https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210312A0AAON00)
2. The  stock is slightly overvalued and I have a hard time comparing it to  other stocks or indexes. (data source yahoo finance)Trailing P/E 	16.15   Price/Sales (ttm)	1.94  Price/Book (mrq)	1.46  Enterprise Value/Revenue  7.28  Enterprise Value/EBITDA  11.38

Is  it overvalued?How do you expect the corporation's performance if  Uranium spot and long-term contract prices increase?Would you  invest?Would you rather get an ETF with overall exposure or other  individual miner stocks?

This past year has been one hell of a year for this retailer. The pandemic was a driving factor for the growth we saw take place this year with Chewy adding over **5 million new users**. They reported positive growth quarter after quarter leading up to the pandemic (they were poised for success and executed perfectly), in addition to a hopeful outlook on customer retention moving forward as a result of covid. Who wants to switch back to lugging bags of pet food around? They will also benefit from the generational ""trendiness"" of the company as they continue to grow and expand their services. 

""Just order from Chewy"". I remember my dad always telling me to ""just order from amazon"" whenever I wanted something I could not find in stores. He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....

# In the works....

**Compounding -** this is service offered by Chewy's pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their ""in house"" patients. 

**Connect with a vet -** pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Some key figures -**

&gt;**2.8% in net sales increase per customer ($363/customer)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Net Cash from operating activities up to 63.4 mil from only 1.6 mil the year before** 

&amp;#x200B;

Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. 

Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. 

Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon's 1 month window. Chewy's pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. 

We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues."|investing|Chewy Due Diligence - I am adding more!|147.0|0.9

After some buzz in media with some quite heavy players investing I thought I'd reach out too see if I could join in. Seeing as I'm no millionaire this will be one of the few times I'm able to particiapte. I belive in their business model bigly and honestly think they have a very good chance of succeeding.

Up until now I've only invested in stocks and mutual funds so when it comes to investing in privately-held companies what pitfalls and financial key metrics should I look at / ask them?

The company today:

* Current outstanding shares: 6m
* Implied equity value: 23m USD

They are about to initiate another round of funding, this will be a large round where they are trying to raise 440m USD since they are scaling up substatntionally from local to national distribution and sales in order to supply demand , if sucessfull it will change the numbers to:

* Outstanding shares: 15.5m
* Estimated valuation: 440m USD

Estimated earnings/projections look good but what specific answers should I ask them before jumping the gun and what key metrics should I try and calculate?"|investing|Investing in non-traded company|152.0|0.92

These trades take a little execution but do not require professionals. In the recent past, there were VERY simple bets that returned ~10% a month with even less risk.

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives to some of its solutions(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO. Brexit may create some difficulty in the short term, but on the whole, it would be highly positive.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).


Analyst price targets range from $280 to $405.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards. For reference, PLTR is expected to grow 30% for the next 4 years, isn't really profitable and stuff and look at PLTR's valuation metrics(P/S etc). While STMP will not likely grow that much, it does have good growth potential in the 10-15% range(along with M&amp;amp;A possibilities).

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows almost all the various stamps website growing hugely(Metapack declined) in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)


*How this will play out?*
It will jump heavily before its earnings report in June and will dump after the earnings report(most likely scenario). This is how it played out in all the last quarters. It’s a classis case of buy the rumour, sell the news. Do remember though, past events don't really dictate future events

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart because of its volatility.

And has very little options volume. So it’s kind of a shares play.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

Also, their cash position seems to suggest they will likely conduct an M&amp;amp;A which could negatively affect the stock in the short term.

But what people forget is you also don’t want to buy long-duration equities,” Bernstein, CEO and CIO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told CNBC’s “[Trading Nation](https://www.cnbc.com/trading-nation/)” on Wednesday. “What’s a long-duration equity? Simply put, it’s one with a high P/E \[price-to-earnings ratio\].”

“There were tons of promises made about what the future was going to look like. Those promises came true between 2000 and 2010. Largely, they came true,” he said. “But the tech sector gave you negative absolute returns for a decade.”

“I don’t think too many tech investors today are prepared for negative absolute returns for three, five or 10 years,” he said.

“If the nominal economy is getting stronger, you want stocks that are going to be very sensitive to that improvement in nominal economy,” Bernstein said. “That outlook for the next several years is probably going to favor cyclicals over more secular growers.”

GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.
XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”
Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.
“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”
XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.
The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.
XPO has retained Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

The Department of Labor released its weekly report on new jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here were the main metrics from the report, compared to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg:

   Initial jobless claims, week ended March 13: 770,000 vs. 700,000 expected and 712,000 during the prior week

   Continuing claims, week ended March 6: 4.124 million vs. 4.034 million expected and 4.144 million during the prior week

Initial unemployment claims were expected to hold below 800,000 for a fourth consecutive week. Still, initial jobless claims remain above the Great Recession-era high of 665,000 from 2009. And new claims still need to fall significantly further to return to 2019 levels, when new claims averaged just over 200,000 per week.

A common index investing strategy is some S&amp;P500, some international and put some away in bonds/bank (percentages don’t really matter for this example)

I’m personally from Australia so the common advice is some in Australian shares, some in international shares and some in the bank account/bonds.

The Nikkei has some big problems (in my opinion- the Bank of Japan becoming the biggest holder of it being the biggest problem). It has a problem with an aging population.

You are, of course, buying a piece of Earth. When that piece of Earth generates income and the company is doing everything it can to grow... you should at least consider allocating a portion of it to your portfolio. Dividend focused companies are growth companies, too.

Agree (pronounced Ay-gree) focuses on investment grade, recognizable tenants such as Walmart. They are mostly triple net but do on occasion assist with development efforts, which aligns with how they describe their best tenants as partners. They're a bit unusual here--like STOR, a non-IG counterpart--in that they actively work with powerful companies rather than being a merely absentee landlord. Yet they still benefit from the high margins of triple net leasing--gross profit hovers at 87%, net income at 36%.

They also are working with some ground leases. Tenant vacates, they get the land at no cost. This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings.

Since this post, numerous people have messaged me with more information around FTFT. I personally found it very insightful and thought this community would as well. I've looked deeper into those comments and this is what I've found.

This is not financial advice.

If you don't know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:

- FTFT plans on liquidating its shares

- FTFT is financially unstable

- FTFT shows signs of fraudulence

**FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders**
---

What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.

Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:

- Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html))

&gt; The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share

- Purchase of Asiasens Investment Holding Pte. Ltd. ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html))

&gt; Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited is acquiring 70.59% of the equity interest of Asiasens by using 2,160,000 shares of common stock

- Purchase of Spondula ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-and-spondula-signed-term-sheet-for-potential-acquisition-301135582.html))

&gt; According to Term Sheet, the acquisition price is expected to be $3.06 million and the consideration will be paid in FTFT's common stock

The list goes on. If they could, they'd buy their coffee using common shares.

They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:

- 2/11/21: 2 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-11-9-million-registered-direct-offering-301227178.html))

- 1/14/21: 3 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-15-million-registered-direct-offering-301208607.html))

- 12/24/20: 4 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-8-million-registered-direct-offering-301199246.html))

And the most frightening one...

- **2/26/21: 240 million share dilution** ([source](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&amp;RcvdDate=2/26/2021&amp;CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&amp;FormType=DEF%2014C&amp;View=html)): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone's share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:

&gt; As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).

Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can't find where the other 20% comes from.

This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there's a date associated with it:

&gt; Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about **March 18, 2021**, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.

Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But they can whenever they want.

**FTFT is financially unstable**
---

First off, isn't is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What's probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans ([source for all referenced lawsuits](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006)).

- Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)

&gt; SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.

- Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)

&gt; SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.

- China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)

&gt; SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.

- China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)

&gt; In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.

But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I'm just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!

- Luwei ($3 million in shares)

&gt; On April, 11, 2019, Xi’an Arbitration Commission made its decision and ordered SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to repay RMB 3 million investment to Luwei. Mr. Luwei applied with Intermediate Court of Xi’an (the “Court”) for enforcement of the arbitration award which process was terminated by the Court due to no assets for enforcement. As of December 31, 2019, SkyPeople China has not repaid the amount.

- Shaanxi Overseas Investment Development Corp. ($1 million in shares)

&gt; SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) failed to make the interests payment and Shaanxi Overseas Investment filed the lawsuit for breach of agreement. On December 26, 2019, Yanta District Court of Xi’an City (the “Court”) ordered SkyPeople China to pay Shaanxi Overseas Investment the preferred share redemption amount of RMB 5 million plus penalty which is calculated based upon the RMB 5 million at a rate of 24% a year.

- Shaanxi Wanyuan Construction Co., Ltd. ($8.5 million)

&gt; In July, 2019, the Baoji Court ordered Guoweimei (subsidiary of FTFT) to pay construction and decoration costs of RMB55.07 million to Wanyuan, plus interest. As of December 31, 2019, Guoweimei has not repaid the amount.

**Worse yet, FTFT even admits that their financial instability in September of 2020** ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm)):

&gt; The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**FTFT shows signs of fraudulence**
---

Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1000%** ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)).

In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)). It's even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.

- Yu, lasted 3 months

&gt; On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

&gt; On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Wang lasted 7 months

&gt; On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

&gt; On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Simon &amp; Edward LLP lasted 1 month

&gt; On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon &amp; Edward, LLP (“Simon &amp; Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

&gt; On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon &amp; Edward, LLP (“Simon &amp; Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

- BF Borgers, the current accountant (we'll see how long they last)

&gt; On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm

Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let's look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) ([source](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0))

I'll let the report speak for itself:

&gt; Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.

There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.

So, while the strangeness in FTFT's auditing doesn't prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.

**In Conclusion...**
---

I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.

---

**The Risks:**
---

Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:

- The scariest -- I am wrong:

I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I'm an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.

- I am right, but the stock price goes up:

As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.

- I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn't matter:

There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.

As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.

Happy trading."|investing|[DD] $FTFT, a $400 million Chinese scam pt. 2|103.0|0.89

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&amp;iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&amp;P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&amp;A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:**  [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

I will try and update progress on my $DS positions periodically.

[Full memo here](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos)

Great insight regarding the new stimulus: 

&gt;On TV on February 7, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded to a question about inflation risk posed by the proposed Covid-19 relief package with a long discourse on the importance of delivering relief to Americans who are suffering. Few would argue with that premise. She also made clear that she believes it’s better to provide too much relief than too little. True as well. But that doesn’t mean (a) the more relief the better or (b) there aren’t risks attached. Experts from both sides of the political aisle have questioned whether the $1.9 trillion relief package under discussion is too much and/or misdirected; Larry Summers, a progressive economist, wrote to that effect in The Washington Post on February 4:


&gt;*. . . a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 — an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.*


&gt;*In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package — but without any new stimulus — the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.*


&gt;*In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large. . . .*


&gt;*Another [way of assessing the scale of a fiscal program] is to look at family income losses and compare them to benefit increases and tax credits. Wage and salary incomes are now running about $30 billion a month below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, and this gap will likely decline during 2021. Yet increased benefit payments and tax credits in 2021 with proposed stimulus measures would total about $150 billion — a ratio of 5 to 1. The ratio is likely even greater for low-income individuals and families, given the targeting of stimulus measures. . . .*


&gt;*. . . while there are enormous uncertainties, there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability. (Emphasis added)*


His conclusion is also key:

&gt;The bottom line is this: given current conditions, should investors be at their usual risk position, more defensive or more aggressive? **While the risk-adjusted returns of most asset classes seem to be at rough equilibrium relative to each other, all absolute returns are ultra-low, commensurate with today’s equally low interest rates.** On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be in one’s normal stance, perhaps with a modest bias toward defense. Since the rewards for moving further out on the risk curve – such as yield spreads – aren’t lavish, I have trouble seeing this as a time to aggressively chase high returns. **Moreover, the surer one is that rates will soon rise meaningfully, the more cautious one should be today.**"|investing|Latest Memo from Howard Marks: 2020 in Review|12.0|0.7

That includes everyone from novice investors to advanced and sophisticated investors, and everyone in between.

One of the most concerning things I hear is this.  

""You should by X.""

""Why?""

""Oh, it was 300 dollars yesterday.  It's 250 now.  So it's cheap.  It's going to go back up"".

""What's the market cap?""

""What's that?  I just told you it's 250.""

""Uhhh?""

""Again, it's 250.  So cheap!  It was $300 previously.""

Now, everyone here knows this, so this isn't a 101 lesson at all.  Instead, it's the term that's been coined, that's call the 'Apple stock analogy'.

Companies are notoriously difficult to price.  You have to know all the complex financials, their current and future product line, their management team competencies, the trends in the industry, etc.  I must admit that I've *never* invested in a stock, knowing all of these things *well*.  Particularly the management team competency.  Imagine that it takes month to learn how amazing a coworker is.  What kind of time investment would it take to vet managers from other companies that you've never met?  How do you access information about them?  How much time would it take?  Perhaps you've read their book?  But how much research goes on here for most investors?  Is the information reliable, or is it hyped?  In any case, the point is, it's hard to properly value a company, which is the opposite of a piece of fruit.

That's where apples come in.  Most people generally know the ballpark value of an apple for their location  It's easy to price.  In California, where I live, it's not unreasonable to pay $0.50 to $1.50 for a single apple.  Let's say $1.  Then, it becomes easy to illustrate the absurdity of things.  

""Hey, apples were $300 yesterday.  They are $250 today.  You should buy cause it's so cheap.""

""What, $250 is ridiculous for an apple....that's not worth it.""

""Exactly.""

Anyway, that's the 'Apple Stock Analogy'.  

Now, all that said, the reality is that people are buying $250 apples, left and right.  And then $300.  And then $350.  If apples were going up 10% a month, after how many months would you notice? When would you finally buy in?  When would it be worth it and a fair price for an apple?  Interesting thought questions.

But the talk of FOMO, greed, draw of easy money, broad access to investing through simplified mobile apps, layers of hidden data, hype, fundamentals, value investing, dogpiling, cycles, big players, scored earth, pumping/dumping, and how all these things can affect the market, and how investors should consider them, are totally different topics.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&amp;P500 to meet the average of 7%. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

LUNA  IMOA is a long hold that has a  chance at super rocketing at any time.  LUNA should be up around 20  dollars a share by Xmas, or alot sooner  depending on ARK

Luna   Innovations, Inc. engages in the development and manufacture of fiber   optic test and measurement, sensing, and instrumentation products for   the automotive, aerospace, energy, and infrastructure industries. It   operates Products and Licensing; and Technology Development segment. The   Products and Licensing segment include sale of fiber optic test,   measurement, and control instruments and modules. The Technology   Development segment focuses in the provision of applied research for   customers in primary areas of focus, including sensing and materials   such as coatings, adhesives, composites, and bio-engineered materials.   The company was founded by Kent A. Murphy in July 1990 and is   headquartered in Roanoke, VA.

Luna Innovations ([LUNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUNA?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   is a unique business with abundant revenue growth and operating   leverage. It currently trades at a value multiple and should rerate as   its results show its inherent growth and profitability. Currently   trading at a $265 million market cap with $26 million in net cash on the   balance sheet, the company is underfollowed by Wall Street with only 2   analysts covering the name. LUNA trades at an Enterprise Value to   Revenue (EV/R) ratio of 2.5x on 2021E revenue of $96 million, and an   EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.7x on 2021E EBITDA of $17.5 million. I believe   these multiples are very low relative to the sustainable 15%+ top-line   growth and 40% EBITDA growth of the company going forward.

Luna  is a fiber optic testing company  that uses fiber in a unique way. As  such, it lacks head-to-head  competition in many of its markets. This  lack of competition is  obviously a boon to pricing and margins but is  also detrimental as no  Wall Street analysts are incentivized to cover  the company as it has no  peers to amortize the coverage effort over or  to compare to on a  valuation basis. Luna’s business is split into two  divisions, Lightwave  and Luna Labs. In the September 2020 quarter,  Lightwave comprised 73% of  the total while Luna Labs made up 23%.

The   Lightwave division sells fiber optic testing products and is itself   split into two parts, Sensing and Non-Destructive Testing and   Communications Test and Photronic Control. The Sensing business uses   fiber optic strands as sensors and can measure strain, temperature,   acceleration and vibration, and thickness over long distances. These   capabilities can be used in many applications. For example, when the   Polcevera Viaduct bridge in Genoa, Italy, was rebuilt after being   destroyed in an earthquake, it was outfitted with fiber optic sensors   and measurement systems from Luna to enable real-time health monitoring   of the bridge. Luna works on a handful of similar projects each quarter   but this pace could accelerate rapidly if a long-awaited  infrastructure  bill is passed in the United States. Smart  infrastructure is topical now  and Luna would likely benefit from any  incremental projects in this  area.

Another example of Luna’s Sensing technology was announced on 10/15 where Luna, in partnership with Shell’s (NYSE:[RDS.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.A?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) (NYSE:[RDS.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.B?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   GameChanger early-stage-technologies program, developed, for the oil   and gas industry, an “innovative concept for measuring in-situ stresses   in subsurface rock using its fiber optic sensing solutions. When   deployed, this technique would provide critical measurements with   unmatched consistency and depth resolution, allowing safer and more   efficient well operations.” While at a very early stage, this is a large   opportunity for the company.

The company has a partnership with Meggitt ([OTCPK:MEGGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGGF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)),   a large aerospace component supplier, to develop a fire sensor to be   used on commercial and defense aircraft. Starting with new Airbus   planes, these sensors will likely be retrofitted into the existing   aircraft fleet over time. This opportunity has been pushed out somewhat   due to Corona’s impact on the aerospace industry. While this is a   long-term opportunity, it shows the breadth of industries that can take   advantage of Luna’s technology.

Luna’s   sensors are also used to detect material thickness in composite   materials. In the B-22 Stealth Bomber, the anti-radar coating thickness   must be uniform to work properly. Luna’s sensors can detect micron   thickness abnormalities that would cause the bombers to show up on   radar.

Luna also recently inked a   deal with Land Rover where every new Land Rover Defender has a handful   of Luna sensors on it to detect corrosion over time in different   environmental conditions. This is an example of Luna’s sensors being   used in production vehicles, not just test cases.

These   Sensing examples demonstrate the wide range of end cases of Luna’s   technology. This breadth results in 20%+ growth in this segment each   year. The breakout opportunities include more production deals like Land   Rover and Meggitt and the result of an infrastructure buildout in the   US.

The Communication test business can detect and pinpoint flaws in fiber optic networks to the millimeter. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:[LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   uses Luna’s OBR 6200 to test the complex fiber optic networks on its   F-22 fighter jets. While Lockheed has used a few of these testers in the   past, it just placed an order for over 100 testers to be delivered  this  year. At a $65,000 ASP per tester, this amounts to an order of  over $6  million, definitely enough to move the needle at a small  company like  Luna. There remains a large opportunity at Lockheed for  testers to be  used with its other aircraft and additional opportunity  for testers to  be used at other defense contractors such as Northrop  Grumman (NYSE:[NOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)).

Financial   firms that facilitate high-speed trading are also customers of Luna.   Luna’s testers can measure the exact length of the fiber route used in   trading and also can detect any latency in such networks.

Luna’s   testers are also important in the production of silicon photonics.   These chips combine silicon circuitry with optical capability and are   becoming more prevalent in optical networks. Luna can test these chips   during their fabrication as well as when they are complete to ensure   they perform up to specification.

Luna’s   other division is called Luna Labs. Luna Labs uses government funding   to research material science to produce innovative products that Luna   can then use in its Lightwave division. This business is about 25% of   Luna’s entire business.

Luna is   experiencing a positive mix shift as its Lightwave business grows faster   than its Luna Labs business. Gross margins in the Lightwave division   are about 62% while gross margins in the Luna Labs business are about   28%. Lightwave is growing about 20% and Luna Labs is growing about 7%.   Thus, over time, overall gross margins will rise as Lightwave becomes a   bigger piece of the business. Also, overall revenue growth will improve   as the faster-growing Lightwave business becomes a larger part of the   overall pie.

What is the right  way  to think about valuation for this business? Without any true comps,  it  is necessary to look at absolute valuation for a growth company. I   forecast revenue to grow at a 17% clip for the next few years and  EBITDA  to grow much faster, at a 40% rate as the company leverages its  fixed  cost structure. These assumptions result in $33 million in EBITDA  in  2023 on a $131 million revenue base. Applying a growth multiple of  20x  to that EBITDA gets you to a $21 share price, or about a 160%  return  from current levels.

1. In the last 6 months, their webpage traffic has almost doubled. From 22M in September to 36M in February. More visitors to their webpage tells me that more people are interested in their products.
2. They are looking to hire more people than their competitors. Nvidia has currently around 1000 open positions, compared to 700 for AMD and 650 for Intel. This tells me that the company is growing. But it’s also interesting to see what kind of people they are hiring. I like that they are looking to hire people for their Autonomous Vehicles Platform - huge future opportunity.
3. Highest employee rating in the industry. People like working for Nvidia (if we should trust sites like Glassdoor and Indeed), more so than their competitors. The CEO approval is at an all time high and I believe that this will help them attract even more great people in the future.

On top of this, financials looks rock solid with increasing revenue year over year.

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy."|investing|eBay due diligence and why I think the stock is undervalued in an expensive market|575.0|0.92

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.  
**In the end the two I landed on were:**[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data  
**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
* What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
* Which social media is the most profitable?
* What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
* How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

**Other interesting finds:**Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasibleStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%**Conclusions:**Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better. "|investing|A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates|206.0|0.94

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology &amp; tourism growth
* AI &amp; data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential."|investing|Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock seeing an increase in chatter over the last few weeks.|44.0|0.89

However, traders will likely be disappointed if they are expecting sunnier projections to translate to changes in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern. The Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment, but virtually no one expects action at this week’s meeting.

The term refers to a companies ability to keep competition at bay over the long term life cycle of the business, maintain majority market share and favourable economics. What force is stopping or limiting the competitions capability to compete? What stops the competition from cutting their lunch? A company can have one or more of the five types of economic moats: intangible assets, cost advantage, efficient scale, switching costs, network effect. 

Here are Some examples of the economic moats/competitive advantage of some companies (or what I believe to be the moat) :

Apple — Apple’s brand power, the belief in its product superiority by consumers and its ability to create a large cult following, allows the company to price its products at double the competitions and still outsell the competition in the market place. 

Coca-Cola — The powerful brand behind Coke gives them the ability to demand higher margins and outsell the competition. Coke the brand is directly associated with happiness. Coke is a product where the customer will reject the competitions equivalent at a discount, and buy the Coke product at a premium. 

Intel — Intels vertical integration and its operations across the entire supply chain line in the chip sector, gives intel the ability to outdo the competition on every level and hold majority market share. One year intel will focus on chip innovation, the next year it will focus on production innovation and capabilities. Despite fierce competition from AMD and NVIDIA, intel has maintained its market share of the industry.

Amazon.com — Amazon is an operating system for society and daily lives of individuals. It has created a cult following who truly believe Amazon is a necessity of life equal to water, food and oxygen. Some Amazon prime members have and do become suicidal when they lose access to their account. The brand has made itself into an integral part of the day to day lives of individuals, and has made life without Amazon inconceivable for its customers. 

Facebook — Facebook takes advantage of network effects, product and brand power. As more people start using Facebook, then more people will be attracted to Facebook because their friends and everyone they know use it, it becomes a social necessity. Facebooks product and brand is so powerful, even its strongest and fiercest critics still use it.

To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html

So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.

3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.

Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed's ""operation twist"" might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]

4) Also, while ""inflation expectations"" have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I'm not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon."|investing|People worried about the 10y yield going out of control should recognise some things.|323.0|0.94

TL;DR: 

I think this is the new paradigm. 

For these reasons I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets.

Company:
Adjustments on the balance sheets to reduce the carrying amount of certain right of use assets and finance obligations associated with leases.... 


(Overestimated the value of the leases they have entered into. Reduction in size of assets and associated lease expense).  


 Company:
·An increase in the loss accrual relating to certain service contracts;


(Probably more serious that the above. They have mispriced service contracts and need to account for more losses as a result).  
 

Company:
·Recognition of non-cash impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets, including certain right of use assets and certain fixed assets;


(Probably the most serious. These assets being impaired are non-cash in nature now... but they would have been cash at some point, e.g. capex to build these assets. At its more nefarious... they paid money or provided capex to customers and they just aren't getting the benefits back).  
 

Company:
·A reclassification of certain costs resulting in a decrease in Operating expenses - Research and development expense and a corresponding increase in Cost of revenue


(Overestimated the gross margin, cost moving from development to cost of service. Therefore less tech spend... more manufacturing and service spend).

....

All in all seems pretty serious to me. That last set of accounts were a big red flag with negative revenue being delivered. In these situations its a good opportunity to scan the last set of accounts... see what  you could haven't learnt and what to watch out for.

Edit: The comment about non-cash by the company really annoys me. Suppose plug power raised 1bn from investors. They spent that money building a factory they expect to return 100m a year. A year later it turns out they are getting 20m and that factory should only be worth 200m. That's okay then! (Sarcasm) because its non cash... well sorry that 800m was cash one day... cash we gave you. You destroyed it when you spent it. You are just telling us you did today.

Edit: Suggest 5bn to 10bn is about right for this business... and this is optimistic. That would put it at about 10 to 20 usd. That might sound crazy but that is only where it was 4 months ago."|investing|Plug power - unravelling the jargon|74.0|0.91

Hello, I want to do a DD today on a bad company which I've purchased puts on. $FTFT (Future Fintech), a 'fin-tech blockchain {insert buzzword}' company that I am near 100% certain is a Chinese scam.

This is not financial advice.

---

**So, what do they claim to do?**
---

Their website: www.ftft.top

Enter at your own risk. This website is not HTTPS secured and has a ""warning"" rating from Web of Trust.

According to their website, they are a leading blockchain R&amp;D company incorporated in Florida, founded in 1998. They own and operate a blockchain-based online mall, a digital payment system, a cross-border e-commerce system, and a blockchain incubator.

WOW, they do so much!

**And where do they do it?**
---

First thing you'll notice is that while they are incorporated in Florida by their SEC filing, the actual office address is in New York City. Specifically:

*Americas Tower, 1177 Avenue of The Americas, Suite 5100, New York, NY 10036*

Now it's interesting that they have Suite 5100 because the Americas Tower actually only has 47 floors. **Suite 5100 doesn't actually exist.** I called the leasing office and they confirmed that each floor's suite is named after the floor itself. Now, maybe there is some secret floors available only to high-end clientele or maybe their counting system is different than the leasing office said. Perhaps, I'm just wrong here. We can give FTFT the benefit of the doubt and say this is a legitimate mailing address.

&gt; EDIT: It appears that Suite 5100 is a virtual office leased out to Regus who rents out to FTFT. Thanks /u/elcup

It doesn't matter, their true operations is out of Beijing, China and this is where the fun really begins.

**A juice company turned blockchain technologist**
---

Sound strange? It gets stranger...

FTFT, in 2017 (at the height of the BTC craze) wowed investors by turning to blockchain. Why was this so surprising, because before this, they were called ""SkyPeople Fruit Juice"" and they sold fruit juice ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/tiny-fruit-juice-company-soars-on-speculated-move-into-bitcoin-that-likely-isnt-real.html)).

So, juice company into finance, a natural transition, right?

Well, surprisingly, no. In order to make this jump, FTFT need to start acquiring companies with financial expertise like mad. According to their website, their portfolio consists of 2 companies:

- Nova Realm City: a blockchain technology value community... whatever that means. This company is based out of China and uses the NRC coin which they claim 35 million exists. First off, only 35 million? That's extremely low float for a ""digital asset community"". Furthermore, I can find no evidence that NRC actually exists.

- InUnion: a blockchain-based life insurance platform. This company is also based out of China and as far as I can tell, it does not have its own website. The link provided by FTFT only goes to an information page with a shitty pamphlet screenshot: https://imgur.com/7YWc9OZ. Notice in the screenshot that there are still red underlines in the names as if this was a screen grab from Microsoft Word. This is the real image they used for this company... Also notice that every customer will also be considered a staff member as well as an investor. What!? WTF does that mean?

Okay, so these are the companies that FTFT publicizes for themselves. But what about the companies they don't put on their website?

**Their ""finance"" acquisitions**
---

FTFT is reportedly acquiring tons of companies to ""expand"" its business (presumably blockchain and finance business) and shore up its expertise (presumably in blockchain and finance).

A quick Google search pulls up a number of subsidiaries by FTFT:

https://imgur.com/0L70WG1

Now, let's first go through some of the companies:

- Christie Peterson Development Corporation: a company originally under H. B. Covey, Inc. which was later acquired by a non-operations company (they have no operations) Entech Environmental Technologies. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001019687-04-000739/)) What is Entech Environmental Technologies? Well, its none other than FTFT! ([Source](https://edgar.sec.report/CIK/0001066923)) They have also gone under the name of Cyber Public Relations! ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-005964/)) Neither of these companies have websites including Christie Peterson Development Corp.

- FT Commercial Management (Beijing): a company formed to acquire Sichuan Tema Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. This company provides financial services to the supply chain industry. Other than that, it is impossible to find more about this company. Interestingly enough, the revenues of this company actually exceeds the **market cap** of FTFT yet they are purchasing it in common stock. ([Source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/financial-services-technology-corporate-news-greater-china-products-and-services-ownership-changes-6e1794f0cf96194018b5fcb3962c4c2b))

- Asiasens Investment Holding: now this one wasn't even in Google it was so recent. But they announced the acquisition here. ([Source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html)) Now, if we look this one up, we get a hit from ""The Grid"", some sort of yellowbook for corporations. ([Source](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd)) This company, which was purchased for **$15 million** of common stock, has less than 10 employees and a business address of: 195 PEARL''S HILL TERRACE, #01-05, Singapore 168976. If you look up this business address, you'll be surprised to find that it's actually... **a residential address for some dude working out of his apartment.** https://imgur.com/xsUl9Hx. Thankfully, this one was unable to get regulatory approval and has since been cancelled. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

- Blocknance Financial International SRL: This was probably the **only** blockchain company that I saw in their acquisition strategy. It is based out of the Dominican and was to be purchased in... drum roll... common stock. Unfortunately, it was also cancelled due to FTFT's inability to get regulatory approval in Hong Kong. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

I can go through the list of acquisitions and since the cancellation of some of their more recent acquisitions, they have already announced more. You can see this on their own website. https://www.ftft.top/en/news.html.

Here is the absolutely terrifying part: **EVERY ACQUISITION IS PAID FOR IN COMMON STOCK.** Not only this, but they are diluting their common stock as quickly as possible through direct offers where they issue more stock in exchange for cash. This is all found on their own website!

In my personal opinion, this is a house of cards just waiting to fall.

**So, what part of their business IS legitimate?**
---

Well, they are rather proud of their ""Chain Cloud Mall"", a blockchain based online retail front...

It is true that they own an online storefront which can be found here: http://www.gksharedmall.com/

Now, right off the bat it seems like a normal online retail site. It has no mention of blockchain or any blockchain-related technology, but let's let that slide for a second. If you go on the front page and click on any of the advertised products, you'll notice one glaring problem with this site: **NONE OF ITS PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE**.

What???

Try it yourself. Change your location to Beijing or another center of commerce in China even. I tried 10+ products and could not make a single purchase no matter my location. All of it is unavailable so unless they had the most monstrous selling season in the history of ever, or these products were never available for sale in the first place. So wtf is this site then? Short answer: I have no idea.

Okay, maybe let's try their next product, NONOGIRL, a global e-commerce platform whose trial launched about a year ago in April of 2020...

It doesn't exist. There's no mention of it ever again. It either never went live or never existed in the first place.

DCON, a coin touted by FTFT for blockchain incubation and technical services!

And... it also doesn't exist: https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R.

---

So, wtf does FTFT even do? They are acquiring internal advertisement companies, supply chain financing companies, asset management companies, and insurance companies. The **ONLY** blockchain related company they sought to acquire actually failed to go through due to regulations.

I have no idea what this company does, if it does anything. All I know is that they are liquidating their shares as quickly as humanly possible. Everything they purchase is through shares. They probably offer the baristas in Starbucks common share instead of cash. This looks like a penny stock pretending to not be a penny stock with wild acquisitions announced every week that never go through.

Is this company a fraud designed to drain investor cash? I can't say for sure. But my findings are above and you should make your own decision.

&gt; EDIT: Looks like they have an SEC filing for a massive dilution of shares. Though, this is dated Feb 26 and it hasn't hit the market yet. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&amp;RcvdDate=2/26/2021&amp;CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&amp;FormType=DEF%2014C&amp;View=html - Thanks /u/boatbitter"|investing|[DD] FTFT, a $400 million Chinese scam|1819.0|0.96

**Recommendation: BUY SMG with a 18-24 month price target of $275 (P/E, EV/EBITDA, Perp. Growth), representing a 17% upside from the current price.**
SMG is NOT a marijuana stock, and comparisons to the regular ""Reddit basket"" of marijuana stocks is disingenuous to SMG's business model. It is a gardening and cultivation stock that recently acquired a hydroponics company that gives the company exposure to the marijuana market from a distance. Due to this, they trade at lower betas and valuation multiples than typical marijuana stocks and still source revenue from their regular gardening US Consumer Segment, currently supplemented by Hawthorne which is exploding in growth.

**Two Catalyst Events:** Virtual Investor Day on 4/8/21 and 2Q20 Earnings on 5/5/21. Both these days will allow the opportunity for the management to update their guidance and tone on FY21 and the future. Emphasis can be expected on Hawthorne and projections for growth.

**Company Overview:** The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company manufactures, markets, and sells consumer lawn and garden products in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments: U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne, and Other. 

**US Consumer:** It offers lawn care products, such as lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, other durable products, and outdoor cleaners, as well as lawn-related weed, pest, and disease control products. The company also provides gardening and landscape products, including water-soluble and continuous-release plant foods, potting mixes and garden soils, mulch and decorative ground cover products, plant-related pest and disease control products, organic garden products, and lives goods and seeding solutions. 

**Hawthorne:** In addition, it offers hydroponic products that help users to grow plants, flowers, and vegetables using little or no soil; lighting systems and components for use in hydroponic and indoor gardening applications; and insect, rodent, and weed control products for home areas. 

---
**Hawthorne Analysis**: This is the growth portion of SMG and where this analysis is focused. Historically focused on lawn and garden products, SMG completed their acquisition of two hydroponics companies in 2015 to move into the marijuana market in 2015 operating under the name Hawthorne, which currently makes up ¼ of SMG’s revenue. 

* With pending marijuana reform on a state and federal level, Hawthorne is primed to explode in growth over the next five years off the back of a Democratic majority in the Legislative branch in support of reform – blue wave is hot and GA runoff wins are positive for outlook. 
* Management is extremely bullish on Hawthorne’s potential in the near and long-term (noted in 4Q20 ([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/7ee63590-92ad-4aae-a1fe-d2a99ac12e1e)) and 1Q21([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-first-quarter-results-us)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/33c0d8bc-8fa5-4393-9532-e49494e12ad7)) earnings and [Raymond James Investors Conference](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/05623e13-ae53-4f8c-89ac-6d4bd767db48) + [Truist Consumer Symposium](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/fd136668-3d44-433d-910e-16969ee69297) presentations in 1Q20). Hawthorne was growing 70% YoY back to June 2019; shows the velocity of growth pre-pandemic.
* Markets like Michigan and Oklahoma were stifled by COVID in 2020 and are expected to rebound in 2021/2022. New markets including NY, PA, and VA are planning and implementing marijuana reform bulls and are expected to open in the coming years. These markets can potentially grow to compose a majority of future Hawthorne revenue. SMG recently completed the construction of a R&amp;D facility in British Columbia and will allow the company to push new products and methods to supplement their Hawthorne product line (notes below on facility). 

---
**US Consumer Analysis:** The company has performed incredibly well through COVID as consumers improve their garden and lawn in lockdowns nationwide; revenue was up 30% in FY2020. Growth is expected to continue this US Consumer segment as COVID impact falls into the summer and consumers return to retail stores with stimulus money in their pockets. 

* Management went in depth into their US Consumer segment at the RJ Investors Conference (linked above) so more color can be found there. Mgmt called it a ""sticky industry"" where 80-90% of consumers come back the next year to buy more SMG products. Competitors are present on retail shelves, but the staying power is with SMG, not the rest.
* The segment found incredible revenue (especially compared to many industries) during COVID as people were stuck at home over the summer and rebuilding their gardens and lawns.

---
**[Recent 1Q21 Earnings](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/) - 02/03/21**

* Company-wide sales increased 105% to $748.6m in 1Q, driven by support in US Consumer and continued momentum in Hawthorne
* Reported 1Q profit: first time ever in company history (business is seasonal with strong 2Q and 3Q)
* 1Q sales for Hawthorne increased 71% to $156m. Strong demand in all categories of Hawthorne
* 1Q sales for US Consumer increased 147% to $408m. Purchases at retail partners increased 40%
* Heavy investment into marketing – Super Bowl ad, “targeted and driven” approach to social media

**Outlook on Performance**

* Noted in the 1Q21 earnings linked above.
* Full company FY21 sales growth of 1%-6%
* US Consumer expected ""positive sales growth"" (SMG updated guidance on US Consumer on 3/1/21)
* Hawthorne FY21 sales growth of 20%-30%

**State Legalization Progress**

* New York: NY Senate Bill S854 would legalize for recreational use. Cuomo: “Not only will legalizing and regulating the adult-use cannabis market provide the opportunity to generate much-needed revenue, but it also allows us to directly support the individuals and communities that have been most harmed by decades of cannabis prohibition.”
* Virginia: On 02/27/2021, the VA General Assembly approved legislation that would legalize the sale and possession of recreational marijuana for adult recreational use beginning on January 1, 2024. Governor has not yet signed the legislation and may propose amendments that would speed up the effective date of the proposed law.
* New Jersey: On 02/22/2021, NJ Governor Murphy signed into law the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), legalizing marijuana for adult recreational use in New Jersey and prohibiting employers from taking adverse action against employees solely because they use marijuana.
* Pennsylvania: PA Governor has made several calls for state legalization, working on legislation.
* South Dakota: Voters approved a medical marijuana program in the state, but Governors and the legislature have introduced bills to delay the implementation of the program.
* Other states: CT, FL, HI, MD, ND, OK all have introduced bills into the legislature for marijuana reform.


---
**R&amp;D Facility in Kelowna, BC**

* Laboratories, indoor grow suites, training areas. Testing cultivation systems and techniques using lighting, fertilization and irrigation systems, growing mediums, and research protocols. 
* Also includes research on cannabis genetics and growing systems to provide cannabis products.
* Innovation is the keyword for Hawthorne. Especially with LED lights, innovation will allow Scotts to push new products.
* Mgmt had a great point elucidated in the Raymond James Conference: Compare Hawthorne to TV. TV’s have lasted forever, but innovation is strong. You likely do not have your 20-year-old tube TV even though it may work. SMG pushing innovative products and methods to marijuana cultivation promote a sphere of influence in the cultivation industry.

**Model Assumptions and Valuation**

I've also created a financial model that includes a DCF valuation with three share price calculations (P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Perpetual Growth). While the confidence of each method is medium, the fact that each method implies around the same share price raises the confidence level. Excerpts of relevant sections are attached. A screenshot of the [Unlevered Free Cash Flow Buildup is attached here.](https://i.imgur.com/t6Wo7hL.png)

[Revenue Growth Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/USmgg83.png)

* Assume 6% revenue growth in FY21, with USC, Hawthorne, and Other growing at 0.5%, 21.6% and 31.1% respectively, congruent with management's guidance above.

[General Income Statement Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/1dPFEW0.png)

* Gross Profit Margin is expected to ""decline 125 to 175 basis points"" in FY21, and the GP Margin assumptions reflect this.
* In connection with SMG's acquisition of Sunlight Supply in 3Q18, they announced a company-wide restructuring effort to reduce operating costs and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Operating Margin assumptions reflect this rise.

[WACC was pulled directly from Bloomberg, and is 8.7%.](https://imgur.com/a/Qm2XNZv)

**Valuation Results**

*Perpetual Growth*:
A perpetual growth rate of 2.10% was chosen for this calculation by [finding the sumproduct of SMG's geographical share of revenue and the respective GDP growth for each region](https://i.imgur.com/tDa8BcY.png). ""International"" is defined by the G7 countries minus America. 

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/yTRXXV7.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs Growth rate [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/CiA78BQ.png)
* Implied Share Price is $271.59


*EV/EBITDA*: An exit multiple of 14.1x was chosen for the exit EV/EBITDA exit multiple method. Included companies in the comparables analysis to arrive at the exit multiple include CHD, CF, MOS and CTVA.

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/HucM0qV.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs EV/EBITDA [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/hxw2gQe.png)
* Implied share price is $271.75

*Price To Earnings*: A simple P/E comparable was also included, but since comparables to SMG are far and few between, it is not a truly strong data point. P/E used the same comparable companies as the EV/EBTIDA calculation, and a screenshot [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/jxipRSs.png).

* Implied share price is $281.57

---
**Recap**: Huge growth in Hawthorne makes SMG a prime play for returns with a 17% upside from current valuations. Hawthorne is exploding and you want to get in on the fround floor before legalization occurs with the current ""blue wave"" and cultivation becomes more common. SMG has ""sticky"" US Consumer segment that currently makes up 75% of their revenue, but Hawthorne is expected to cannibalize this revenue and result in a USC/Hawthorne revenue split of 55%/45% in the coming years. My model has forecasted the growing potential of the company and arrived at a 17% upside for SMG.

Alphabet said early Tuesday that it is slashing the fees it charges app developers who use the Google Play store, months after Apple announced a similar move amid criticism of the high costs of such charges.

Shares of Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) were up 1.5%, at $2,084.40, in recent trading.

In a blog post Tuesday, Alphabet said that it was lowering the fee it collects to 15% from 30% on the first $1 million app makers bank from its app store. Alphabet made the decision to slash its fees, which takes effect July 1, amid regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department and several state-led efforts.

Apple (AAPL) made a similar change last year, reducing its rate to 15%—also from 30%—but limited the change to developers who report annual sales of less than $1 million. Apple is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulators for potential antitrust violations reportedly related to its app store.

Google said in the blog post that 99% of app developers would have their fees cut in half. It wasn’t immediately clear what impact the change would have on the company’s third-quarter sales and beyond.

Alphabet includes its Play store revenue in its “Other” revenue segment, which also lumps in hardware and nonadvertising products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions. The entire segment reported 2020 revenue of $21.71 billion.

&amp;nbsp;

Good evening fellas, Professor Flux here, bringing you some quality DD on $WMT. I originally wrote this post for /r/WSB, but figured it would also be useful here. I censored out most of the ""ape talk"", but if some slipped through the cracks, let me know and I'll edit it out! 

&amp;nbsp;

Although most people view Walmart as a boring, boomer dividend stock, I strongly believe that they’re poised to reclaim their ATHs over the coming months. What initially caught my eye about this entire play was the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). A steep 11% dropoff after earnings led to an aggressive bounce, which was then promptly held at the longtime support level of 132/133. This leads us to the overarching question we need to answer *before* we get into the DD - Why did Walmart plummet in the first place?

&amp;nbsp;

---

#Why did Walmart Plunge?

Before we get into the DD, it’s important that we understand *why* Walmart dropped 11% in the first place. With overall sales *increasing* by 11%, eCommerce sales gapping up by 70%, a 20 billion dollar stock buyback, a dividend hike, and more, it may seem polarizing that Walmart *dropped* after reporting such strong earnings. 

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, it seems as if investors (and algos) weren’t happy about the potential ER guidance, as well as the abundance of covid related costs. It’s no secret that operating expenses went up due to COVID, and as a result, Walmart’s operating margins took a hit to the tune of $1.1 billion. Although temporary, investors didn’t like that COVID related expenses increased due to the overall number of covid cases increasing (go figure). 

&amp;nbsp;

Furthermore, in the ER call, Walmart announced they were allocating more money towards future growth, which offput investors (for reasons beyond me). Walmart plans to invest 14 billion dollars to supply chain automation and additional technologies, while also looking to rollout Walmart+ to more users. They’re also looking to increase the average employee wage to above 15$, resulting in better service, and improved quality of life for Walmart employees. Walmart continues to build upon their next generation business model, investing in automation to fuel future sales and earnings growth. Unfortunately, short term investors dislike this, as these investments take away from the potential earnings of 2021, yet those with the foresight to look past this, see this as a viable, and necessary cost for sustained long term growth.

&amp;nbsp;

#Earnings Report Summary

First things first, we need to go over the ER numbers, which were bullish as fuck. On  February 18th, Walmart reported that :

- Overall sales increased by over 11%
- Overall revenue was up 7% on the quarter
- Spending per visit increased by a factor of 22% 
- They added **$10 billion dollars to its annual free cash flow**, as that metric jumped to $26 billion from $14.6 billion in the prior year
eCommerce sales increased 70%
- General expenses were *lower*, resulting in overall operating income increasing by 17%, even after accounting for COVID related expenses
- The dividend was increased for the 48th consecutive year in a row
- They are instantiating a new 20 ***billion*** dollar share buyback program

&amp;nbsp;

These numbers alone are enough to warrant a *jump* in Walmart’s share price, but in fact, the opposite occurred, with Walmart tanking 11%. Fortunately for us, this provides us with an awesome dip buying opportunity! From fundamentals, alone Walmart is an awesome investment at this price.

&amp;nbsp;

---

#Underlying Catalysts

Luckily for us, aside from rock solid fundamentals, Walmart also has plenty of “hidden” catalysts in store, which could easily lead to a gap up in stock price.

&amp;nbsp;

**Stimulus**

I hate to be that guy using the “stimulus” cop-out, but on average, the new stimulus cheques are going to end up in the pockets of retail stores. Sure, “on paper”, stimulus is going to positively affect *all* companies, but it’s important to understand that retail stores such as Walmart, Home Depot, Dollar General, etc, tend to **benefit the most from it**. The average American isn’t going to be buying a fucking Tesla, or a brand new iPhone with his newly minted $1400. I’m sure some people will, no doubt, but on average, these stimulus cheques are going to be spent at retail stores, for mundane, everyday things such as groceries, home furnishings, sporting goods, cheap electronics, etc, all of which is supplied by Walmart and similar retailers. Theres is a fuckload of stimulus money hitting the banks of average, everyday Americans, and most of it inevitably *will* end up being spent at Walmart. If you don’t believe me, the CEO of Walmart literally [verified all this too.] (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-spent-their-stimulus-checks-on-discretionary-goods-such-as-bikes-video-games-and-clothes-target-and-walmart-ceos-say-2020-05-20)

&amp;nbsp;

Another null-point to note is that many “savvy” Americans are going to look to invest their stimulus cheques. Although most cheques will end up getting stolen by MMs, some will still end up being invested in regular ass shares, bringing up the *entire* market, increasing Walmart’s value with it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Partnerships, Expansions, and Diversified Growth Opportunities**

Although not explicitly advertised, Walmart has many diversified opportunities for continued growth under their belts. I’m not going to comprehensively write about them all, since each would be an *entire* DD post in and of itself, but refer to the list below to get a comprehensive summary.

&amp;nbsp;

- Back in June, [Walmart partnered with Shopify](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace). As a result, thousands of sellers from Shopify would join the Walmart Marketplace, increasing traffic and generating more revenue from fees product transactions.
- In August, [Walmart partnered with Instacart](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/walmart-and-instacart-partner-in-fight-against-amazons-whole-foods.html) to provide same day grocery delivery. This takes market share away from other grocery stores, while also combating services like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime. This partnership helps Walmart establish a dominating position in the online grocery market.
- Back in July, [Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sells-its-indian-stores-to-flipkart-11595484002) allowing Walmart to aggressively expand into India, further growing their business, and profits.
- Along a similar vein, Walmart has been expanding all around the world, to places such as [China](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/walmart-china-stores) and [Africa](https://talkbusiness.net/2018/09/walmarts-7-year-gamble-in-africa-slowly-paying-off/), creating significant opportunities for the continued growth of the company.
- In North America, [Walmart+ is being rolled out to more and more eligible Americans on a month by month basis](https://www.statista.com/topics/1451/walmart/). Soon enough, all of America will have access to Walmart+, drastically increasing profits.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Forgotten TikTok Deal**

Remember the whole TikTok debacle? No? Understandable. Although it’s been a while, it’s technically *still* in play. Although it was promptly swept under the rug after the presidency change, there is still potential for the [TikTok acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/with-tiktok-deal-walmart-could-gain-a-front-row-seat-to-the-next-generation.html) to go through. As per the original agreement, Walmart will be granted a 7.5% stake in the newly founded company, which would be incredibly bullish for Walmart. Walmart would control and engage in an intensely valued platform, while having a front row seat to the next generation of consumers. The possibilities of this partnership are endless, but for the time being, it’s still in limbo. Regardless, it’s still another point us investors need to consider, as news could come out at any moment, causing Walmart to rocket.

&amp;nbsp;

#An Ideal Entry

As touched upon in the intro, what initially caught my eye about $WMT *before* I started my research, was the [price action](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). After the ER it plunged down to it’s $126 support level, bounced hard, and then came to rest at an even stronger level of support, at $132. This level of support serves perfectly as our entry point. At this level, a move to the downside is *extremely* unlikely, since algos and institutes gobble up shares likely candy when WMT is trading under $132. Furthermore, even if the price does move against us, we have levels of support at $126 and $125, allowing us to average down on our position in the unlikely event of another downside move. We have an awesome opportunity for entry here, alongside great downside protection.

&amp;nbsp;

There are multiple ways you can play this bounce. You can go with ye old faithful, and “buy the fucking dip” like Warren Buffet does, loading up on shares and reaping the rewards of stock growth and dividends at the same time. Alternatively, for those with a greater stomach for risk, you can look to pick up **$140 C 4/16**, **$140 C 05/21**, or **$160 C 06/18**. Each of these options are relatively cheap, and offer an immense upside. Furthermore, with these longer dated contracts, you won’t get bitten by theta as badly, and will have plenty of time to reap the rewards, and for the price to become ITM.

&amp;nbsp;

#Bearish Counterpoints

No DD would be complete without a bear thesis. Alongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. In this section I’ll look to address some of the overarching concerns that many investors may have about the stock.

&amp;nbsp;

The various expansions and investments Walmart is making are very expensive in nature. If they fail to succeed in their ventures, it would be a colossal failure, and would ultimately be a huge revenue sink and waste of capital. Although they’re not necessarily difficult or risky, we need these investments and expansions to be successful to ensure the future growth of Walmart as a company. Another thing to consider is that these growth ventures may already be priced in. Although the growth cases for these scenarios have not yet been properly documented, it’s still something we as investors need to consider.

&amp;nbsp;

Next, some are afraid that raising the minimum wage of Walmart employees up to 15$ will eat into company revenues. Although this may be true right out the gate, it will likely be shadowed by the fact that eventually *all* companies may have to do such a shift due to government policy. Walmart doing this *first* may initially be a negative, but it will ultimately have to happen at some point down the road. If a minimum wage policy is not enforced by the government, this policy *will* eat into Walmart's revenues, but may potentially be offset due to the enhanced quality of employees Walmart may be able to acquire with the newly increased wages. Time will tell.

&amp;nbsp;

Lastly, through Walmart+ and their eCommerce department, Walmart enters a space heavily saturated by specialty online stores, which may currently have the edge over generalist marketplaces. In the short term, while they expand, they’ll have to wrestle away market share from these specialized brands, while retaining customers, which is no easy feat. Fortunately for Walmart, this likely won’t be an issue in the long term (hooray globalization), but short term, it’s still something we as investors need to consider. Furthermore, one also needs to consider that Amazon is working within this sector as well. Although Walmart has been able to compete with and wrestle away some of Amazon’s share, we are unsure if this growth will be sustained into the future.

&amp;nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, following a healthy earnings report, a nice dip in Walmart’s price provides us with an awesome trading opportunity. With rock solid fundamentals, many bullish catalysts in play, and stimulus right around the corner, Walmart is poised to reclaim its ATHs, and make us some money. This play is incredibly safe, so grab some shares or options, and enjoy the ride! If you like my posts and want more finance content, you can find links to my socials on my profile!

1615902668.0|0.0|t3_m69ifj|295.0|"**General Overview**

*  We are at a time where investor demand has been proven in the cannabis sector, yet the stocks for the leading US companies in the space are difficult to buy and undervalued compared to their hyped Canadian counterparts. These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in legal cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.

**The Market:**

* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. 

* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. 


**US Cannabis as an investor:**

* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. 
 
* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.

* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. 


**Haven’t we already missed the boat?**

* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Sundial Growers, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. 

* It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. 


**Canada vs USA** 

* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. 

* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. 

* Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. 

* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. 

* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. 

* The states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.


* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.



**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**

* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:

* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)

* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)

* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.



**Who are these US cannabis companies?**

I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. 

**Curaleaf:** 

* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.
* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.
* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY
* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA
* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. 

**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**

* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. 
* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.
* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.
* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin


**The bear cases**

***It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?***

* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. 

***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***

* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.

* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. 

* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.

* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. 



**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**

* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.

* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.
 
* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:

* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.

* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. 

* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. 

* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. 

* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. 



**My Strategy:**

* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. 


* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and tailwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. 


**Discloser:**

*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future.

Android app stores including those operated by Huawei, Xiaomi and Tencent have reportedly blocked downloads or removed Alibaba's ""UC Browser."" CNBC was unable to immediately confirm the report.

It comes after the UC Browser was criticized on a TV show about misleading online medical advertising that was broadcast by CCTV, a state-owned broadcaster.

It comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday that Beijing's crackdown on large technology firms was just beginning. ""Some platform companies' development is not standard and risks exist,"" Xi said in an address to China's top economic committee, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

In my 6 years, I've heard every year that the stock market was about to collapse. I think its possible the stock market faces a ""lost decade"", but I am also a big believer in the innovation within the pipeline that we could benefit from in the coming years.

One area of the market I am confused by is the electric vehicle space. It seems everyone is so high on the space when I think it presents a lot of risks:

1. A lot of EV companies are trading like they will be the dominant player in the EV space and have a large % of TAM. In reality, very few of these companies will win any significant amount of TAM and many of them will crash (no pun intended). In the last few years, we've seen the EV space expand from Tesla to Volkswagen to General Monitors/Ford to the darling SPAC companies. Many of these companies have never sold a electric car to the general public.
2. The car industry is a tough industry to invest in. In my investing career, the car industry has been the ugly orange haired stepchild. Too many companies, large capital requirements, and tough margins. I dont understand how the EV space would change that. Sure, certain technologies might make manufacturing easier that can improve margins and lower capital requirements... but you are still going to pinching every penny, especially if the market remains this saturated.
3. Many EV car companies are dependent on certain tax credits and government handouts. We can argue the merits of the government incentivizing people to buy cars and the merits of the government giving money away to help car companies be competitive. How reliable are these credits in the future?
4. It's great you want an electric car to save the planet, but if your EV charging station is powered by coal, or oil/gas, you arent doing as much good as you think. The charging stations seem to need a lot of further infrastructure. I dont think many, if any, markets globally have the infrastructure in place to account for the expected increase in EV vehicles, much less EV charging stations built using power from ""clean"" sources.
5. EDIT: I thought of one more. All of these companies will likely need to raise huge amounts of money in the future. Many of them are pre-revenue and still have to invest millions, if not billions, into infrastructure. The ability to raise money now is easy, but it might not be so easy in a few years. 

I dont pretend to be an expert at this. My research is still on going and my ignorance might be showing here. However, I just see an industry that is growing in awareness and therefore stock valuations, but still have many questions and less answers.

I have seen some short reports in recent weeks. If anything, I'd buy General Monitors and buy LEAP puts in SPAC EV companies. I think the existing ICE car companies like Volkswagen, Ford, and GM... along with Tesla, have a huge advantage over some of these smaller players."|investing|I have to be missing something about the EV space|649.0|0.91

It’s common knowledge that the stock market in the USA has crushed the rest of the world (I’ll use EAFE here to proxy for non-U.S. developed market equities) since the peak of the Japan bubble (call that the end of 1989) or over the last, say, ten years, right? Well, yes. But here we are interested in how much of the outperformance is from the USA’s fundamentals (or perhaps carry) beating the rest of the world versus the USA’s valuations richening versus the rest of the world.


From 1980 to 2020 the USA has outperformed EAFE by 2.1% per annum. A hefty number (though not statistically significant). Now, as you might guess, there have been some changes in absolute and relative valuation over this period. 

We see a giant repricing with the USA getting relatively much more expensive on CAPE and ending effectively at a peak. You know what regression is coming right?


 I regress the difference in annual return (USA minus EAFE) on the contemporaneous difference in annual percentage change in CAPEs over 1980–2020:


USA minus EAFE = 0.4% + 0.94 * change in valuation, R2 = 91.5% (0.7) (19.6)


So, when we adjust for the change in relative valuation, the return differential shrinks from an economically (if not statistically) significant 2.1% per annum to an insignificant (both ways) forty basis points. The victory of the USA over EAFE for the last forty years is almost entirely coming from it getting relatively more expensive.

Basically, if you were estimating long-term expected returns going forward, would you want to build in CAPE appreciation going on forever at the rate in the graph above, or would you remove that effect and look at the intercept? I think the answer is obviously the latter and hope by now you agree! 


This has real implications for asset allocators where the “removing the effects of massive changes in valuation” method argues for much more non-USA exposure than one would get just looking at simple realized returns and assuming they are a fair sample for the future (and this is without assuming any mean reversion from the historic high valuations of USA vs. EAFE). 


Basically, those who’ve changed their portfolio, selling their international stocks and putting it in the USA, because of the 30 years of USA outperformance, are kind of building in the assumption that relative CAPEs, which have gone up 2-3x for the USA vs. EAFE, do so again in perpetuity.

Through this latest phase, the company has invested in additional options that allow shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

Schneider has expanded its technology lineup of Schneider FreightPower, first announced mid-year 2020, to help shippers save time and increase their access to capacity. The company rolled out the accompanying app to carriers in Fall 2020.

Through this latest phase, Schneider FreightPower aims to provide shippers with options to manage their businesses right at their fingertips. The digital marketplace allows shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

“Our goal is to make Schneider FreightPower the digital access point for services and solutions for both shippers and carriers,” said Mark Rourke, president and CEO of Schneider. “Shippers of all sizes come to us with their toughest transportation challenges, and we are solving them faster than ever before. That means our customers get more value – and get more done in a day.”

Schneider FreightPower offers access to tools such as:Instantly quote and bookFreight visibility 24/7 (load in process, last location, pickup and ETA), including email notifications (pickups, deliveries, and specific order completion)Access to load documentsReal-time reporting


“Schneider FreightPower is an exciting, new way to differentiate Schneider and connect to small shippers and carriers which represent a $1.2 trillion segment of the transportation market,” said Rourke. “We are giving shippers time, solutions and the best at what we deliver— access to full Schneider capabilities and options. It’s all about improving capacity, so shippers can do business better than ever before,” said Rourke.

**Company History:**

I spoke to IR (investor relations) she said she won't leave the company until she fixes the volume problem. She's the only employee that's worked for a public company, so the old guard is a bit difficult to talk with. The owner is a big baller, he's worth 100m all from the company. Started it 20 years ago, he's 87 and still goes to work everyday. You can set up a investor call with him at 8pm at night (his time), you'll catch him smoking a cigar and drinking scotch. Fucking chad.

**So what's the problem?**

A couple of things... $IGIC went public via a SP4C on March 22nd, 2020. The SPAC offering was at \~$10 the market Armageddon that ensued caused them to drop below $7 and they've traded sideways since then. The original investors (Argo Group being the largest one) would like to exit their position but they are unable to for 2 reasons.

1. Lockup period ends in March, it's any day now that the SP4C lockup ends.
2. They won't sell at a loss. Until this thing moves above $10 you won't see a real marketplace exist for it... This stock needs liquidity and we can provide that to create a real marketplace for it.

**Let's talk fundamentals are valuations...**

These types of business' are valued on their book. Let's take a look at where $IGIC stands relative to it's competitors.

As you can see $IGIC is trading a multiple of .87x price-to-book relative to $KNSL which is 10.15x price-to-book. $IGIC is growing almost as quickly as $KNSL. $IGIC is profitable, in it for the long run, growing quickly, and way underappreciated.

**Conservative PT:** $12 or \~1.5x price-to-book

**PT:** $30 or \~4x price-to-book

**Bullcase PT:** \~$70 or \~10x price-to-book

As you can see this is anywhere from a 2 bagger to a 10 bagger. I am very long $IGIC and am excited for the liquidity and volume issues to be resolved. When this has a real marketplace this stock will move... quickly.

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

**About the company:**

Sesen Bio is a late-stage company developing fusion protein medicines. Their fusion protein approach tethers a tumor-targeting antibody fragment to a protein cytotoxic payload to form a single protein molecule designed to selectively and broadly kill cancer cells while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells and to activating the body’s innate immune response system.

**What are they doing and why I think it´s important:**

The company is initially focused on the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

Their main drug is it’s called **Vicineum.** This is being evaluated in the [**Phase 3 VISTA** trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02449239?term=vicinium&amp;rank=1) for the treatment of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have been previously treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which is the current standard of care for NMIBC. While BCG is effective in many patients, challenges with tolerability have been observed and many patients will experience recurrence of the disease. If BCG is not effective or a patient can no longer receive BCG, the recommended option for treatment is radical cystectomy, the complete removal of the bladder.

*In case you ask how many people are vaccinated with the BCG feel free to click this link:* [*http://www.bcgatlas.org/*](http://www.bcgatlas.org/)*.*

The preliminary findings are highly encouraging, demonstrating that treatment with Vicineum results in clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability. In addition, the data are consistent with the results of Vicineum in their completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vicineum** can potentially treat **head and neck cancer.** They have completed Phase 1 trials for an injectable form of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN that have demonstrated anti-tumor activity and safety. Data from these trials also demonstrated that certain patients who were injected with Vicineum in one tumor had responses in non-injected tumors as well, suggesting that Vicineum may promote an anti-tumor immune response and combine well with immunotherapies. In addition to the Phase 1 trials, Sesen Bio completed a Phase 2 trial in the United States, which demonstrated a reduction in the bidirectional size of the principle targeted tumor observed in 71 percent (10/14) of patients evaluated in the study.

**Some important fact about Bladder Cancer:**

\- Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. If BCG is not effective one of the options is **complete bladder removal.** Bladder cancer is a highly prevalent cancer, but options for treatment have not changed in more than 20 years. At Sesen Bio, they want to help you save your bladder. **Vicineum**™, is administered in the exact same way as BCG but works differently and may offer a new option.

\- This year, an estimated 83,730 adults (64,280 men and 19,450 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with bladder cancer. Smoking accounts for 47% of all these cases.

\- Bladder cancer mostly affects older people. About 90% of people with bladder cancer are older than 55. The average age people are diagnosed with bladder cancer is 73.

\- The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The general 5-year survival rate for people with bladder cancer is 77%. If the tumor is invasive but has not yet spread outside the bladder, the 5-year survival rate is 69%. Approximately 33% of bladders cancers are diagnosed at this stage.

**My opinion on all this:**

Vicineum appears to be the new great thing around bladder cancer, numbers are showing to be great and this is close to receiving an FDA response which is expected to be positive. This is the 6th most common cancer and if the BCG fails the most common treatment is bladder removal. Sesen is trying to avoid this by providing a great solution. The company is partnered around the world to provide this once approved and is aiming beyond the USA. The balance sheet looks impeccable, no debt, 44M free, indicators look great for the short, mid, and long-range with a huge upside on a price target. 

I see this having some big news soon and driving the price very high up. 

Another important thing is that there are not many videos or spam around it so the price isn´t pumped in my opinion. 

There is a BCG shortage which might help Sesen Bio get their drug approved even faster. This shortage has been going for some years now. 

I will not buy more shares as I already own a lot but I see this as a great investment.

If anyone needs a refresher, here's a short analysis between lump-sum versus averaging by Vanguard: [https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum).

Vanguard makes a compelling case about market timing. Assuming a retail trader can't time the market (even if you don't support EMH, it still is obvious that this is pretty darn difficult), you may believe it's simply for those who are scared of realizing losses, which is exactly the point they make.

I would like to propose a slight tweak to the concept: instead of spreading the payments out over time, spread them out over price. You start with an initial exposure, and scale up when the market takes a hit, while scaling down to take profits during bull runs.

Let's demonstrate why this works out. Take a random price point the SPY has reached in the past: 250 USD. How many times did it reach this point? Five times. Take another one, 270 USD: **ten times.** How about 290 USD? **Fourteen times.** But maybe that's just a recent trend. Things might've been different back when it was around 100 USD, right? Nope, **ten times it reached 100 USD.**

I haven't conducted an elaborate backtest, but it's clear the amount of setbacks to any particular price level is rather large, just as it's clear the whole thing is positively drifting in general.

Given that we know this, instead of investing 100% at once, consider what would happen if you invested 60% at 100 USD and invested an extra 20% for every 10% drawdown, and scaled down by 5% for every 10% increase? In other words, we scale up by double the drawdown, and realize half of our profits.

Starting in May '68, let's say we started investing with 60 shares for a 6,000 USD position with 4K left in cash. Two months later we hit a low of 88 USD per share, meaning we now own 80 shares at roughly 7,000 USD with a little over 2K in cash. We dip to below 72 in May '70 resulting in 100 shares with 800 USD remaining in cash. We hit four profit targets on the way up to 105 USD and end up with 80 shares and 2.6K in cash for a total of 11K USD. That's already doubling our profits while significantly reducing our exposure at any given time!

We could continue to test and demonstrate this, but the point is clear; we all know this will generate less returns in a very strong bull market, and create very strong opportunities in bear markets. We profit when bull runs are facing continous corrections, when the market goes sideways with some swings in between, and we are extremely well-protected against crashes, able to purchase lows and hold whole multiples of shares compared to when we'd just lump-sum.

It's no coincidence the greats such as Warren Buffet hold so much of their available capital in cash and play the waiting game on crashing markets. Ask yourself: when the markets crashed by 50+% over the course of their history, did it ever correspond with a similar collapse of the global economy? Not really, jobs were lost, consumer spending took a hit, some companies went under, but at a global scale we never took a hit even in the same universe as the rate at which the market tanks during those times.

So what's your take on this? Is this even considered ""dollar-cost averaging""? Are there superior alternatives? Or would you consider / are you already applying this in your actual investment strategies?

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115

Interest rates are low, and “lower for longer” has become something of a mantra among policy makers, regulators, and other market watchers. But negative interest rates raise an entirely new set of questions.

After eight years of experience with negative interest rate policies, the initial skepticism (paying interest to borrowers rather than savers was certainly unprecedented) has proven largely misplaced. The evidence so far suggests that negative interest policies have worked.

The evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns.

Since 2012, a number of central banks introduced negative interest rate policies. Central banks in Denmark, euro area, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland turned to such policies in response to persistently below-target inflation rates (most central banks set rates as part of their broader mandate to keep prices stable, thereby supporting jobs and economic growth). These banks were also responding to a very low “neutral real interest rate”—that is, the real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary. The move reflected the central banks’ struggle to boost inflation even when they had already pushed interest rates to zero.

The effects of the COVID-19 crisis, in an environment where many central banks are constrained, have brought back negative interest rate policies to the forefront.

Overall, these policies have eased financial conditions, and, in the process, likely supported growth and inflation. However, negative rate policies remain politically controversial, partly because they are often misunderstood.

Unfamiliar territory

At the time of introduction, many questioned whether negative interest rate policies would work as intended.

There were concerns about risks, given the untested, and in many ways counterintuitive, nature of the move. Would banks, households, and firms shift massively to cash in response to the new policies, thereby weakening the link between central bank rates and other interest rates? Would banks resist cutting lending rates, or even reduce lending to prevent profits from falling? Would negative interest rate policies provide a meaningful monetary stimulus?

Concerns about potential side effects of these novel policies also arose. Chief among the concerns were financial stability risks stemming from lowered bank profitability, and fear of disruptions in the functioning of financial markets and money market funds.

Based on the evidence to date, these fears have largely failed to materialize. Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies. For example, some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy. They also led to lower money-market rates, long-term yields, and bank rates.

Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits—because it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash. Bank lending volumes have generally increased. And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash, interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens.

So far, so good

Any adverse effects on bank profits and financial stability have so far been limited.

Overall, bank profits have not deteriorated, although banks that rely more on deposit funding—as well as smaller and more specialized banks—have suffered more. Larger banks have increased lending, introduced fees on deposit accounts, and benefited from capital gains. Of course, it is possible that the absence of a significant impact on bank profitability mostly reflects shorter-term effects, which could potentially be reversed over time. And side effects may still arise if policy rates go even more negative.

Money market funds in countries that have adopted negative interest rate policies have not collapsed. And, even if the existing “low-for-long” environment does create significant financial stability concerns (as it induces a search for yield or excessive risk taking by financial institutions), negative interest rate policies per se do not appear to have compounded the problem. For example, the increase in bank risk-taking does not appear to have been excessive.

Given this evidence, why haven’t more central banks jumped on board? The reasons are likely related to institutional and other country characteristics. Institutional and legal constraints may play a role, and some financial systems—because of their structure or interconnection with global financial markets—may be more prone to suffer adverse side effects from negative interest rate policies. For example, countries with many small banks that rely more on household deposits as a main source of funding may be more reluctant to adopt negative interest rates.

Even the adopting central banks have moved tentatively, typically with small interest rate cuts because of the risk that negative side effects become more apparent if the negative rate policy lasts for very long, or if rates go very negative.

In sum, the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns. Thus, central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further. And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit—even if they may be unlikely to use it.

Ultimately, given the low level of the neutral real interest rate, many central banks may be forced to consider negative interest rate policies sooner or later."|investing|The evidence is in on negative interest rate policies, and it has largely worked|731.0|0.82
1615738368.0|0.0|t3_m4y0mb|33.0|"Mohawk Group Holdings is a small cap (1B) AI enabled consumer product company.  If you frequent Amazon, chances are you've encountered some of their brands while shopping. Simply put, Mohawk's business model is leveraging their proprietary AI tool ""AIMEE"" to research, develop, market, and manage their 400+ SKUs . Along with making their own products, Mohawk is in the business of consolidating 3rd party sellers on Amazon through acquisitions. Based on their technology's determination of market opportunities present on Amazon, Mohawk decides on whether they can become a market leader in segments by either building the product themselves in 6-8 months (much faster than the typical product development life cycle for larger CPG companies) or acquiring a brand (typically at 2-5x EBITDA) and increasing the contribution margin for all of the brand's products with AIMEE.

Some of their successful brands you can find on Amazon: Healing Solutions, Truweo, hOmelabs, Vremi, Rif6

In a recent interview, CEO Yaniv Sarig also explained that through their integration of AIMEE, they onboard these SKU's supply chains and revenue streams in their system within 24-48 hours of the deal closing (much more efficient than any other CPG like P&amp;G, Unilever, etc.).

To put a cherry on top of everything, Mohawk operates at the moment with **ONLY** 53 employees, yielding around 3.5million per employee in revenue (using 2020 net revenue). In an interview with Sarig he also explains that his vision is to allow for the technology to enable everyone at the company to become ""Super Heros"" and what 1 employee can do with AIMEE, would require 50 employees at a large CPG company.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets look at the financials:

Currently at the price of $35\~ $MWK trades at an attractive 3.13 P/S  with a 50% CAGR since 2017. Mohawk also has improved their gross margins to 45.6% from 39.4% in their latest quarter.

While the CAGR  of revenue is 50%, I believe the revenue growth of the company to be closer to 100%+ growth for next year due to further acquisitions and a recent announcement of potential M&amp;A targets. Direct quote from earnings:

*""We are currently evaluating a strong pipeline of potential M&amp;A targets that in total have trailing twelve month’s net revenue of $522 million and trailing twelve month’s EBITDA of $97 million.""*

These deals which have letters of intent signed are **not** yet included in guidance (which was already raised this quarter) making me even more bullish. Additionally, Mohawk plans to expand to other countries as quick as possible as they have made a recent acquisition in Photo Paper Direct, their first UK based e-commerce move. I believe this expansion to other markets will be a recurring theme with Mohawk in the future.

I believe that at the growth of Mohawk warrants a higher P/S ratio (closer to 6 to 8 P/S like Thrasio, a comparable company). Along with the higher P/S I believe the market is underestimating the potential revenue growth of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

It is important to understand the risks of any business so here they are and my opinions:

1. Mohawk is primarily on Amazon and relies on them
2. Expanding too quickly / Dillution
3. Competitors

For the first point, it is not too much of a concern in my opinion as Amazon also wants their 3rd party sellers to succeed on their platform. You wouldn't want to see Amazon made products in the top search for every product you search for. CEO Yaniv Sarig also discusses this point in the interviews and does not seem too concerned about Amazon interfering with their products.

On the second risk, for any small cap, expanding too quickly can always be a problem, but I do not see this as a major problem for Mohawk since they acquire EBITDA positive brands and have such low overheads with their technology and low human capital. Along with this, I believe that the way they are acquiring companies, they are growing at a much faster pace than their potential dilution.

To the third point, Mohawk's counterpart would be Thrasio which is another innovative CPG company consolidating sellers on ecommerce platforms, valued at 3 billion. I believe that this consolidation of sellers on ecommerce platforms has room for many players and while Thrasio is a competitor, there is room in the market for both since ecommerce has such a large TAM.

1615731956.0|0.0|t3_m4vzjt|25.0|"On Friday (3/12/2021) GDRX fell sharply, at one point close to 14%. It ended up closing down just over 10%, on news of a 4th quarter loss. Not a good line to start a pitch, but when you look at one of the large contributing factors to the loss you see that maybe concerns are overblown. The CEO received $285 million in stock based compensation for the companies IPO. GDRX also donated $41 million to charity. And over the next two years there is still $160 million to award the CEO. That's a lot of money to be sure, but it's not a sign of something that is wrong with the fundamentals.

This is a company that was profitable in 2019 ($66 million in income) and is in space that will only grow.

GRDX helps consumers save money on prescription drugs. They partner with pharmacies, get their data from the pharmacies, and in turn help consumers save. With healthcare being such a large part of the US economy and so many people aging and needing more medication, helping people save money is a good thing. And more people will be turning to GDRX to save money as we have more people age. 

A threat to them is if Amazon or Walmart tries to enter their space. But do you trust Amazon or Walmart not to use your data? I don't. I would bet most people don't. GDRX doesn't. They partner with pharmacies and don't get any data from their consumers.

With the recent drop in price, this is a value play. GRDX is a long-term play. I see this company going up 5 - 10x or more in 8 - 15 years. I know that time horizon isn't popular but that's the reality."|investing|Good Rx (GDRX) - is a GOOD investment|25.0|0.7

AudioEye is a SaaS company operating in the niche and fast-growing digital accessibility industry. It provides a software solution for businesses to make their websites accessibility compliant using AI / machine learning without modifying website design or code. This helps companies steer clear of digital accessibility lawsuits (which have been sky-rocketing in recent years) for not providing a suitable website for persons with disabilities. AudioEye also has a help-desk for customers and provides legal support in case a digital accessibility lawsuit occurs. 

Past and present customers include Uber, Samsung, Kia, Tommy Hilfiger and Square.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Jim Crawford and Sean Bradley in 2005. Jim Crawford is no longer involved with the company and Sean Bradley still owns shares of the company (very minor stake), but is no longer on the Board or on the Executive Team (no involvement with the direction of the company).

The current Chairman of the Board and third-largest individual shareholder is Dr. Carr Bettis. He has been at the forefront of the company’s operations in recent years. He’s a serial entrepreneur with previous experience in developing financial science and technology innovations businesses that have been acquired. He received his Ph.D. from Indiana University and is a former tenured professor and researcher. 

The current interim-CEO and largest individual shareholder (through Sero Capital) is David Moradi. He is an entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Sero Capital, a private investment firm focused on growth opportunities in the technology sector.

Recent notable hires include Rob Ulveling as Chief Business Officer (former Product Marketer at Pinterest and Facebook) and Zach Okun as Chief Product Officer (former Product Manager at Facebook and Oracle).

The company has a 3.4 rating on Glassdoor (24 reviews), 44% approval of the Interim-CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and approval of the company’s mission. However, there are many complaints that the company is too profit-focused and that the recent executive team reshuffle has brought along plenty of unwelcome changes and layoffs. Employees speculate the company is being prepared for a possible buy-out or acquisition.

# Industry and competition 

AudioEye is the largest and only publicly traded company specialized on providing B2B digital accessibility solutions.

Notable competitors include Siteimprove, accesiBe, Silktide and other small private businesses.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

AudioEye offers the most complete and comprehensive solution for websites to become accessibility compliant. Their use of machine learning and AI is a big moat when measured up against the technology of competitors. They currently have around 32,000 customers, representing a 370% increase over 2019, which further exemplifies their business strength and relevance.

In an industry with little serious competition, AudioEye’s current financials, brand, customer base and technology represents a huge advantage over competitors. There’s also the advantage that this industry is still small enough that none of the big tech players will bother with it just yet.

# Areas of growth

The digital accessibility industry is still in its early-stages. AudioEye should remain at the forefront of any industry tailwinds and grow accordingly. There’s a ton of potential internationally for their suite of products as more and more countries crack down on and further scrutinize digital accessibility. 

A possible expansion into App accessibility could provide a huge catalyst for growth for the company, in my opinion.

It is estimated 15% of the world’s population has some sort of disability, so you can probably see how huge the market opportunity is for a company that provides a suite of products like this.

If AudioEye continues investing into AI and machine learning, they could develop superior technology that would improve margins exponentially, facilitate rapid expansion and possibly be used for other product suites or applications.

# Potential headwinds 

The biggest threat for AudioEye would be a big tech company suddenly becoming interested enough in the industry and deciding to launch a competitor (specially if they have good AI technology to use as leverage). Although I don’t see it happening any time soon, it would be fatal for a company like AudioEye at this stage.

Also, there are some reports that AudioEye’s technology isn’t that complex and that their recent growth and adoption is mostly based on a culture of fear and ignorance businesses have developed to avoid getting sued. There might be some truth to this, and if a scandal broke out discrediting the technology, dragging adoption down, AudioEye as a company would become worthless pretty quickly.

Tech experts argue that AudioEye’s customers could easily develop the same solution in-house if they really wanted to and without too much hassle and/or added cost.

# Institutional and insider ownership, short interest

* Institutional ownership sits at about 15-16%.

* Insider ownership and major individual shareholders: 

- David Moradi, including indirect ownership through Sero Capital (Interim-CEO): 3,119,600 shares (29.13% of total shares outstanding)

- Jamil Tahir, including indirect ownership through TurnMark Capital (Board Member): 229,564 shares (2.14% of total shares outstanding)

- Dr. Carr Bettis (Executive Chairman): 155,773 shares (1.45% of total shares outstanding)

- Sachin Barot (CFO): 134,834 shares (1.26% of total shares outstanding)


**- Total % of outstanding shares held by insiders: 35-36%.**

* Short interest is currently 20.28% of the total floating shares

# Earnings

**From the latest earning report:**

* Quarterly net revenue was $5.6 million, up 57% YoY
* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) was $1.9 million, up 58.33% YoY
* Quarterly gross profit margin of 73%, up from 66% YoY
* Quarterly net loss of $3 million, up 114.29% YoY

* Full-year net revenue was $20.50 million, up 90% YoY
* Full-year gross profit margin of 71%, up from 59% YoY
* Full-year net loss of $7.2 million, down 7.69% YoY

* Guidance for full-year 2021 of revenue between $30 to $32 million, representing a 46.34%-56.10% YoY increase over 2020

* Spent $2,134 million of quarterly revenue (38.11% of total) and $4,138 million of full-year revenue (20.19% of total) on Stock Based Compensation expenses, which is the principal cause for the widening quarterly EPS loss and the lackluster full-year 2020 EPS improvement.

* Spent $430,000 of quarterly revenue (7.68% of total) and $1.230 million of full-year revenue (6% of total) on Research and Development expenses, which is unusually low for a SaaS company (specially one with AI and machine learning components).

# Balance Sheet

* $9,095 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents 
* $14,631 Million of Total Current Assets
* **$18,254 Million of Total Assets**

* $9,015 Million of Current Liabilities (including $6,328 Million of Deferred Revenue)
* $1,083 Million of Long-Term Debt
* **$10,620 Million of Total Liabilities**

# Valuation metrics

* Market cap: $305.10 Million
* Total shares outstanding: 10.71 Million
* **PE Ratio: N/A**
* P/S Ratio: 14.88
* P/B Ratio: 39.98
* D/E Ratio: 0.17
* **Negative Free Cash Flow (estimated): ($3.5-4 Million)**
* **PEG Ratio: ≈ N/A**

# Principal financial metrics of closest competitor (all competitors are private companies, so I’m comparing it to a smaller-cap, more mature SaaS just for reference. AudioEye should, ideally, achieve gross margins on the level of PagerDuty at some point):

**NYSE: PD**

* Market Cap: $3.461 Billion
* Revenue: $210 Million
* Gross profit margin: 86.20%
* PS Ratio: 16.48

# Price action 

AudioEye currently sits 35.77% below its 52-week high. It’s a highly volatile stock and has corrections in the double digits on a semi-frequent basis. Only fit for investors with a stomach for short and medium term volatility and extremely high risk tolerance.

Current valuation is by no means a bargain and the stock is probably close to fair value or maybe a tad overvalued due to several fundamental risks.

# Pros

1. Fast-growing, possibly huge industry in its infancy and this company has the strongest moat and resources to grab up major market share in years to come.
2. Interim-CEO has a ton of skin in the game with 29% total ownership.
3. 50% insider and institutional ownership (with growing institutional ownership and interest).
4. 90% revenue growth, 71% gross profit margin. Rapidly improving margins and good guidance for 2021.
5. Committed to becoming cash-flow positive this year and will probably become Non-GAAP profitable this year as well.
6. Healthy balance sheet with little debt and enough net cash to sustain the current cash burn for at least 2 more years without diluting shareholders any further.
7. Encouraging recent hires of talent from Facebook and Pinterest.

# Cons

1. Extreme levels of Share Based Compensation expenses is a huge problem in my opinion. It’s dragging very heavily on EPS and Free Cash Flow. The company should aim to pull way back on these expenses at this stage.
2. It’s urgent that the company generates positive Free Cash Flow this year. Things could get nasty otherwise.
3. Lack of continued executive leadership and non-involvement from the founders is a problem.
4. The company is being led by Private Equity firms and owners. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re working towards the company being sold so they can cash out. There’s also a risk that all of these people could cash out at any time and leave the company stranded, diluted and with no leadership to speak of.
5. Not profitable, not cash flow positive.
6. Burning $3.5-4 million in cash per year with a net cash position of $9 million. 


Disclaimer and conclusion: I’m cautiously bullish on AEYE at this point and have a small exploratory position. I truly believe the market opportunity and projected growth for the industry they’re in is insane, but there are several fundamental risks and challenges with the company that need to be acknowledged. Current valuation is probably fair, but not a bargain. Invest at your own caution and discretion."|investing|AudioEye (AEYE) DD - The digital accessibility SaaS leader|10.0|0.7
